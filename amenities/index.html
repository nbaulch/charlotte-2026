  <!-- GREENWAYS OVERVIEW -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Greenways Overview</h2>
    <p>Mecklenburg County maintains <strong>82.5 miles of paved greenway trails</strong> — a genuinely impressive system for a Sun Belt city of Charlotte's size. For a family that runs, bikes, and wants greenway-connected neighborhoods, Charlotte's trail network is a meaningful quality-of-life asset. The most important trails for this family's target neighborhoods are detailed below.</p>
    <p>The greenway system creates car-free corridors through residential neighborhoods, connects parks and commercial areas, and makes active commuting viable. The infrastructure is actively expanding — some gaps and on-street connections exist, but the core of the target neighborhoods is well covered.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- KEY GREENWAYS -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Key Greenways for Target Neighborhoods</h2>

    <h3>Little Sugar Creek Greenway — 19.5 miles (the primary spine)</h3>
    <p>Charlotte's most important greenway — fully paved, mostly flat, and multi-use. It runs the full length of the target neighborhood cluster from NoDa in the north through Chantilly, Elizabeth, Plaza Midwood territory, Freedom Park, Sedgefield, and south toward the South Carolina line.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Key access points:</strong> Cordelia Park (NoDa / north end), Metropolitan Ave near Commonwealth/Elizabeth, Freedom Park (central hub), Sedgefield Park trail junction, Park Road Park (south)</li>
      <li><strong>Bike commute connection:</strong> Connects to the Uptown CycleLink at 7th Street — making it the primary greenway bike commute route for Dilworth, Chantilly, and Elizabeth riders</li>
      <li><strong>Character:</strong> Urban trail with tree canopy; bridges over Sugar Creek; passes through parks and neighborhood greenspace. Not wilderness, but genuinely pleasant and separated from traffic for most of its length</li>
      <li><strong>Running:</strong> 19.5 miles gives real long-run options — Freedom Park south to Park Road Park is a common 6-8 mile out-and-back; north toward NoDa gives a different urban character</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Stewart Creek Greenway — ~5+ miles combined</h3>
    <p>The <strong>best dedicated greenway bike commute route</strong> in the target neighborhood cluster. Runs from the Wilmore area directly into Uptown Charlotte — a largely separated, low-stress path. Connects to the Irwin Creek Greenway system for extended riding. Less crowded than the Little Sugar Creek corridor. If bike commuting is a priority, proximity to this greenway is a real differentiator for Wilmore.</p>

    <h3>Irwin Creek Greenway — 3.2 miles</h3>
    <p>Connects the Wilmore and Seversville area toward Uptown. A functional link in the westside greenway network rather than a destination trail in itself. Important for Wilmore residents commuting by bike.</p>

    <h3>Charlotte Rail Trail — 3.5 miles</h3>
    <p>A converted former rail corridor connecting South End to Uptown. Smooth paved surface, mostly flat, and well-maintained. Popular with lunch runners from Uptown offices and commuters from South End. Not a through-trail for the target neighborhoods specifically, but worth knowing for Uptown-adjacent activities and South End errands.</p>

    <h3>Sugar Creek Greenway — 4 miles</h3>
    <p>Runs north from the Freedom Park / Sedgefield area through Ashbrook-Clawson toward Tuckaseegee Road. Links to the Little Sugar Creek system and extends the rideable range from Sedgefield significantly. Good for extending runs north from Freedom Park.</p>

    <div class="callout info">
      <strong>Greenway Access by Neighborhood (Quick Reference)</strong>
      Dilworth: Little Sugar Creek Greenway directly accessible — connects to Freedom Park and toward Uptown via 7th St CycleLink.
      Chantilly / Elizabeth: Little Sugar Creek Greenway at Metropolitan Ave access point — ~12 min bike to Uptown.
      Sedgefield: Little Sugar Creek + Sugar Creek Greenways accessible; Freedom Park ~2 miles.
      Plaza Midwood / Commonwealth: Little Sugar Creek at Metropolitan Ave; Stewart Creek extension possible.
      Wilmore: Stewart Creek Greenway — the best dedicated greenway commute route in the city.
      NoDa: Cordelia Park (Little Sugar Creek northern terminus) accessible; primarily an on-road cycling area.

  <!-- PARKS -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Parks</h2>

    <h3>Freedom Park — 98 acres (the crown jewel)</h3>
    <p>Freedom Park is Charlotte's best urban family park — 98 acres of amenity density and community draw. It sits at the southern edge of Dilworth and is adjacent to Myers Park, making it accessible by greenway or short bike ride from most target neighborhoods.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>7-acre duck pond with paddleboat rentals</li>
      <li>Two playgrounds (critical for a family with 4-year-olds)</li>
      <li><strong>Spray pad</strong> — essential for Charlotte summers; kids will live here June through September</li>
      <li>Off-leash dog park (important for the dog you'll eventually get)</li>
      <li>4 baseball fields, 12 tennis courts, soccer fields</li>
      <li>Kayak and canoe rentals on the pond</li>
      <li>Concession stand open seasonally</li>
      <li>Discovery Place Nature museum (on-site; undergoing renovation — verify current status)</li>
      <li>Little Sugar Creek Greenway passes directly through the park</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Neighborhoods within biking distance: Dilworth (adjacent, ~5 min), Myers Park (adjacent), Sedgefield (~2 mi, ~10 min), Chantilly (~2.5 mi, ~12 min), Commonwealth (~2 mi, ~10 min). Freedom Park proximity is a meaningful factor in evaluating these neighborhoods — it is the gathering place for Charlotte families.</p>

    <h3>Latta Park — 31 acres (within Dilworth)</h3>
    <p>A neighborhood-scale park embedded in Dilworth, within walking distance of most Dilworth addresses. Spray pad (yes, another one), playgrounds, tennis courts, basketball courts, and open fields. More casual and everyday than Freedom Park — where you'll take the kids after school, not where you'll spend the whole Saturday. The park anchors the eastern section of Dilworth and has a genuinely neighborhood feel.</p>

    <h3>Midwood Park — 6 acres (Plaza Midwood)</h3>
    <p>Small but community-significant: playground, community garden, and an amphitheater that hosts neighborhood events and concerts. This is the gathering heart of Plaza Midwood's community life — farmers market, neighborhood association events, seasonal programming. Don't underestimate it; it punches above its acreage in terms of community function.</p>

    <h3>Independence Park — 24 acres (Elizabeth)</h3>
    <p>A green anchor at the center of Elizabeth. Walking paths, open greenspace, and a community gathering function. Less programmed than Freedom Park or Latta, but provides the breathing room that makes Elizabeth feel like a neighborhood rather than just a street grid.</p>

    <h3>Veterans Memorial Park (Plaza Midwood / Commonwealth area)</h3>
    <p>Multi-use recreational park with baseball, basketball, and tennis. Well-used by Commonwealth families; provides recreational infrastructure that supplements Midwood Park for the more active/sports-oriented use cases.</p>

    <h3>Cordelia Park (NoDa)</h3>
    <p>Sprayground plus outdoor pool — significant amenity for families with young kids in a hot-summer city. Good for summer days if you end up in NoDa or the northern target neighborhoods.</p>

    <h3>Park Road Park (Sedgefield / Park Road area)</h3>
    <p>Southern terminus of the Little Sugar Creek Greenway in the target area. Playground, athletic fields, community facilities. A destination park for Sedgefield residents accessing the greenway system heading south.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- RUNNING & BIKING -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Running &amp; Biking Infrastructure</h2>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Charlotte Running Club</h3>
        <p>A large, active running community with organized group runs throughout the week at varying distances and paces. Routes concentrate on the Little Sugar Creek Greenway and Freedom Park loop. Active on social media (Instagram, Strava) — easy to find the schedule and show up. This is the primary entry point for a runner relocating to Charlotte who wants community. The culture is welcoming; this is not an elite club.</p>

        <h3>The "Booty Loop" (Myers Park)</h3>
        <p>Queens Road West and the surrounding Myers Park boulevard system form one of Charlotte's most beloved running and cycling routes. Tree-lined divided boulevards with low traffic, deep shade, and beautiful historic homes create a 6-10 mile loop that many Charlotteans specifically drive to Myers Park to access. For a runner, this is a genuinely excellent route. Accessible by bike from Dilworth and Sedgefield (via Little Sugar Creek Greenway). No infrastructure required — just show up and run the roads.</p>

        <h3>Little Sugar Creek Greenway Running</h3>
        <p>19.5 miles of paved trail. Common long-run configurations: Freedom Park south to Park Road Park (6-8 miles out-and-back), Freedom Park north to NoDa (8-10 miles one-way with neighborhood transit back). For a regular runner who does 6-12 mile weekend runs, this trail alone handles most training needs without repetition.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Bike Commuting to Uptown</h3>
        <p>Charlotte has made meaningful improvements to cycling infrastructure in recent years and was recognized by PeopleForBikes as one of the most improved cycling cities. Bike commuting from the target neighborhoods to Uptown is genuinely viable — workable for a comfortable road cyclist.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Best greenway route:</strong> Stewart Creek Greenway (Wilmore) — dedicated, separated, low-stress</li>
          <li><strong>Best mixed route:</strong> Little Sugar Creek Greenway to 7th St CycleLink (Dilworth, Chantilly, Elizabeth) — mostly greenway with a brief on-street section at the Uptown connection</li>
          <li><strong>Distances:</strong> 5–7 miles from most target neighborhoods — well within a comfortable bike commute range</li>
          <li><strong>Road riding:</strong> Fine on roads in the target neighborhoods; traffic is manageable mornings; some roads have painted bike lanes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Plaza Midwood: Free Wheelin' Fridays</h3>
        <p>A neighborhood-organized group bike commute from Plaza Midwood to Uptown, departing Friday mornings. This is exactly the kind of informal community infrastructure that matters for building a social network around an active commute.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- COMMUNITY FITNESS & THIRD PLACES -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Community Fitness &amp; Third Places</h2>
    <p>Charlotte has a real active community scene — the infrastructure for finding your people through sport and fitness is genuinely there. It's distributed across different activities: run clubs anchored to local shops and bars, a climbing gym culture that is naturally social, road cycling groups with weekly rides, and a purpose-built communal bathhouse. The pieces are all here; you just build the social network by picking your sport first.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Run Clubs</h3>
        <p><strong>Charlotte Running Company — Monday Night Run (Dilworth)</strong> is the most accessible entry point for a runner new to the city. Free weekly group run departing from the CRC Dilworth store every Monday at 6:30 PM. No registration required, no membership required — just show up. CRC also runs free Tuesday morning track workouts (The Track Project, 6:00 AM at CRC Promenade) and monthly Saturday Pancake Group Runs with marked routes and breakfast after. These are genuinely free, community-oriented events, not marketing hooks.</p>
        <p><strong>Charlotte Running Club (CRC)</strong> is the city's primary organized running organization — active since at least 2001, with group runs across the week at varying paces and distances. Routes concentrate on the Little Sugar Creek Greenway and Freedom Park. Annual membership is $25 individual / $35 family — essentially free — with organized runs throughout the year. The culture is broad and welcoming; this is not an elite club. runCLTrun.com aggregates the full list of active Charlotte run clubs if you want to survey the full landscape.</p>
        <p><strong>Mad Miles Run Club</strong> is worth knowing about: a Black-led, free run club that meets Mondays at 6:30 PM (Social Status), Tuesdays at 6:30 PM (YVY Training), and Saturdays at 10:00 AM at Elizabeth Park. The format is genuinely communal — group warm-up, live DJ, chants, 2-mile group run at any pace, then a block party atmosphere afterward. It is the most socially oriented run club in the city by design. Free, no registration.</p>

        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <p><strong>Bank City Bike Club</strong> is Charlotte's most community-driven cycling collective — founded around healthy lifestyle, social justice, and introducing youth to cycling. Weekly group rides (Tuesdays for urban/road, check Instagram @bankcitybikeclub for current meetup points). Routes are typically 20-25 miles through Charlotte at 12-14 mph — accessible for a wide range of fitness levels.</p>
        <p><strong>Orr Road Cooperative</strong> runs the legendary Tuesday night training rides during spring and summer — more performance-oriented but open, with a strong regular crew. <strong>Trek of Charlotte</strong> and <strong>Bicycle Sport</strong> both organize weekly group road rides for intermediate and advanced cyclists. <strong>Hopfly Bike &amp; Brew</strong> runs a Saturday group ride (1:30 PM, year-round) with 10, 25, and 35-mile loop options — the most beginner-accessible of the road cycling rides. <strong>Charlotte Area Cycling</strong> on Meetup also aggregates gravel, mountain, and road rides any day of the week.</p>
        <p>The <strong>Free Wheelin' Fridays</strong> group bike commute from Plaza Midwood to Uptown (Friday mornings) is worth noting for anyone who lands in Plaza Midwood — exactly the kind of informal community infrastructure that makes an active commute social rather than solitary.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Climbing — Inner Peaks</h3>
        <p>Inner Peaks is Charlotte's premier climbing gym with three locations: <strong>South End</strong> (2220 S Tryon St — closest to Dilworth and target neighborhoods), <strong>NoDa</strong> (newest, opened 2024, beginner-focused), and <strong>Matthews</strong> (suburban). Climbing gyms have an inherently social community culture — the sport requires spotting, beta-sharing, and waiting at the wall — and Inner Peaks leans into this explicitly with a "Climbing, Community, Confidence" philosophy and regular community events. A membership covers all three locations and includes yoga classes, fitness facilities, and access to member events. The South End location is the most relevant for target neighborhoods (10-15 min by bike from Dilworth / Chantilly via Little Sugar Creek Greenway).</p>

        <h3>Strength &amp; CrossFit</h3>
        <p><strong>CrossFit Dilworth (Dilworth Fit)</strong> at 911 E Morehead St is the standout choice for target neighborhoods — an established box that has been operating for 12+ years and is consistently cited for its community culture. Members specifically describe the atmosphere as welcoming and genuinely friendly rather than intimidating. Memberships run $125-$185/month; drop-in from $20. Located on E Morehead St, it is accessible from Dilworth, Chantilly, and Elizabeth without a car.</p>
        <p><strong>Charlotte Strength</strong> at 624 Anderson St (28205 — the Elizabeth / Plaza Midwood boundary) is the independent barbell gym answer for this neighborhood cluster. Open 24 hours, emphasis on community through small group classes, with programs including Barbell Basics, Olympic weightlifting, HYROX training (NoDa Fit), and strength and conditioning. Their explicit community framing — "we're here to build each other up" — is real; this is not a Planet Fitness situation. Free intro session available.</p>
        <p><strong>Crossfit Plaza Midwood (Fitness Factory)</strong> on Commonwealth Ave serves the Plaza Midwood / Commonwealth corridor and includes both CrossFit programming and a powerlifting club, making it viable for barbell-focused athletes who aren't strictly CrossFit oriented.</p>

        <h3>Sauna House — Finnish Communal Bathhouse</h3>
        <p><strong>Sauna House at 1500 W. Morehead St</strong> occupies a restored 1934 building — exposed brick, bow-truss ceilings — and is genuinely a third place, not a gym add-on. The format is communal: large Finnish-style dry-heat saunas accommodating 30–50 people, paired cold plunge pools, and a social atmosphere where you're with others at their own pace. Drop-in rate is approximately $50 for the communal bathhouse (membership options with discounts and rollover passes are available). Private suites exist for couples or small groups at higher rates. Open most days by noon, evenings until 10 PM. Located 8–10 minutes by car from most target neighborhoods. Confirmed open and active as of February 2026. The communal model and deliberate community atmosphere make this worth a monthly or bi-monthly habit — not just a one-time visit.</p>
        <p><strong>SweatHouz</strong> at 1711 Commonwealth Ave in Plaza Midwood is an infrared sauna and cold plunge studio on a private suite / appointment model — more convenient for a solo recovery session, less communal. Walkable from Plaza Midwood and Commonwealth addresses. Think of Sauna House as the social third place and SweatHouz as the convenient maintenance option.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- DOG FRIENDLY -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Dog-Friendly Charlotte</h2>
    <p>The family doesn't currently have a dog but plans to get one — worth factoring into neighborhood and amenity evaluation now.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Freedom Park Dog Park:</strong> Off-leash dog park within Freedom Park's 98 acres — one of Charlotte's best. Large, well-maintained, socially active. Freedom Park proximity becomes even more valuable with a dog.</li>
      <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Dog-friendly trail (leash required). Running with a dog on 19.5 miles of paved trail is a strong daily-life amenity.</li>
      <li><strong>Bark Social (Midtown area):</strong> Social dog park with a beer and coffee bar — the concept is a members-only off-leash park combined with a social bar for humans. Popular with the target demographic in Charlotte. Worth visiting once to see if the model appeals.</li>
      <li><strong>Most Charlotte neighborhoods:</strong> Generally very dog-friendly — sidewalks, tree lawns, neighborhood culture around dog ownership is strong in Dilworth, Chantilly, Plaza Midwood, and Elizabeth specifically.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- FAMILY / CHILDREN -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Family Activities &amp; Children's Programming</h2>
    <p>Charlotte has a robust calendar of family-oriented activities beyond the parks — relevant for twins entering their 4-8 age range during the years right after the move.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Discovery Place Nature (Freedom Park)</h3>
        <p>Science and nature museum designed for children in the 4-12 age range — interactive exhibits, live animals, hands-on programming. Located within Freedom Park, making it a natural addition to any park day. Currently undergoing renovation; verify current status and hours before planning a visit. The combination of Freedom Park + Discovery Place Nature makes this corner of Charlotte an exceptionally strong family destination.</p>

        <h3>Discovery Place Science (Uptown)</h3>
        <p>The larger, more comprehensive version of the discovery museum concept — located in Uptown Charlotte. Planetarium, engineering labs, traveling exhibitions. Worth a monthly visit for science-curious kids.</p>

        <h3>Charlotte Museum of History</h3>
        <p>Historic house museum and exhibitions covering Charlotte and Mecklenburg County history. Grounds include the 1774 Hezekiah Alexander House. Good for age-appropriate history introduction as the twins get older.</p>

        <h3>Mint Museum (two locations)</h3>
        <p>Fine art and craft/design collections. Mint Museum Uptown and Mint Museum Randolph (on Randolph Road, adjacent to the target neighborhoods). The Randolph location is particularly accessible from Chantilly, Myers Park, and Elizabeth.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Charlotte Knights Baseball (Truist Field, Uptown)</h3>
        <p>Triple-A minor league baseball in a purpose-built downtown ballpark. Family-friendly pricing, accessible location (Uptown, bikeable from several target neighborhoods), and the casual pace of minor league baseball makes this an excellent family outing format — especially for kids 4-10 who engage with the stadium experience more than the game itself. Season runs April through September.</p>

        <h3>NASCAR Hall of Fame (Uptown)</h3>
        <p>Charlotte is the center of NASCAR culture — the Hall of Fame reflects that with interactive driving simulators, history of the sport, and genuine artifacts. Worth visiting once; relevant for kids with any mechanical interest.</p>

        <h3>Carowinds (theme park)</h3>
        <p>Located 10-15 miles south of Uptown on the NC/SC border — approximately 30 minutes from most target neighborhoods. Full theme park with roller coasters and a water park (Carolina Harbor) included in season passes. For a family moving from a city without a regional theme park close by, season passes at Carowinds are a summer staple for Charlotte families. Kids in the 4-10 range get exceptional value from it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- WHITEWATER CENTER CALLOUT -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>US National Whitewater Center</h2>
    <div class="callout info">
      <strong>Worth special mention — this is Charlotte's outdoor recreation signature</strong>
      The US National Whitewater Center is a world-class outdoor recreation facility located 8 miles west of Uptown Charlotte. It operates on a scale that surprises most newcomers: flatwater and whitewater paddling on a man-made Olympic-caliber channel, sport climbing walls, mountain biking trails (18+ miles on-site), a zip line, team challenge courses, a riverside music venue, and multiple restaurants and bars — all in one complex on the banks of the Catawba River. Annual individual membership runs approximately $90/person and provides unlimited daily access to trails and most activities (paddling has separate per-session fees). For an active family, this is a no-brainer. The mountain biking trails alone justify membership for regular riders; the paddling and climbing make it exceptional. Events range from concert series (outdoor amphitheater) to running races to beer festivals. If you want to understand Charlotte's active lifestyle potential before moving, plan a day at the Whitewater Center on your scouting trip.

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Charlotte's Food Scene: The Honest Assessment</h2>
    <p>Charlotte's restaurant scene has matured significantly over the last decade. This is no longer a banking town with chain restaurants and hotel steakhouses — it now has a genuine food culture with James Beard Award nominees, serious Southern regional cuisine, a growing craft brewery scene, and a diverse international food landscape driven by significant immigration from Latin America and Asia.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>What Charlotte does well</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Carolina BBQ:</strong> A serious, distinct regional tradition — wood-smoked, vinegar-based, and genuinely excellent at the best spots. A uniquely Southern food culture.</li>
          <li><strong>Southern cooking:</strong> Done with authentic soul at the best restaurants; not tourist-ized.</li>
          <li><strong>Latin American food:</strong> Strong and growing — large immigrant communities have built a real dining ecosystem. Cuban, Peruvian, Mexican, Colombian all well-represented.</li>
          <li><strong>Craft beer:</strong> NoDa Brewing, Resident Culture, Sycamore Brewing are legitimately excellent regional breweries.</li>
          <li><strong>Specialty coffee:</strong> Has arrived in earnest — Undercurrent, Not Just Coffee, and others are doing serious work.</li>
          <li><strong>Wine culture:</strong> Strong; driven by the banking / finance professional demographic.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>What to calibrate expectations on</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The "neighborhood restaurant" concept — a place that's walkable, feels like yours, and is fine any night of the week — is developing in Charlotte but not yet as embedded or dense in most neighborhoods. You'll drive more for food variety.</li>
          <li>The international food scene is spread across the metro rather than concentrated in dense corridors — worth exploring but requires knowing where to look.</li>
          <li>The best date-night restaurants require a car — they're not usually walking distance from a residential neighborhood. This is fine; just calibrate accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

  </div>

  <!-- COFFEE -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Coffee — By Neighborhood</h2>
    <p>Charlotte's specialty coffee scene has genuinely arrived. The best neighborhood shops combine a serious espresso program with a real community feel — the kind of place that becomes a daily anchor rather than just a transaction. Several shops in the target neighborhoods hit that standard.</p>

    </div>

    <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Charlotte-Wide Coffee Standouts</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Undercurrent Coffee</strong> (2012 Commonwealth Ave, Plaza Midwood): Specialty roasting operation, excellent espresso and filter program, good bar design, genuine community feel. If you want to understand Charlotte's specialty coffee scene in one visit, start here.</li>
      <li><strong>Not Just Coffee</strong>: Multi-location specialty shop (Wesley Heights Jay St., Dilworth, multiple Uptown spots). Consistently excellent; warm community feel; the backbone of Charlotte's specialty coffee scene.</li>
      <li><strong>Amelie's French Bakery</strong> (NoDa, plus Uptown): 24/7 operation, French pastries done well, quirky design that rewards lingering. A Charlotte icon for a reason — the kind of place that becomes your "I need to work for 3 hours on a Saturday" default.</li>
      <li><strong>Summit Coffee</strong>: Solid neighborhood coffee with multiple Charlotte locations; consistent quality, nothing flashy.</li>
      <li><strong>Central Coffee</strong>: Community-anchored, known for made-from-scratch pastries; good neighborhood institution feel.</li>
      <li><strong>Dilworth Coffee</strong>: Founded 1989; original Charlotte specialty roaster. The institution, not the trendiest execution, but real community ties and history.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- WALKABLE / KID-FRIENDLY -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Walkable Casual &amp; Kid-Friendly</h2>
    <p>The best casual neighborhood spots are the ones where you can walk in on a Tuesday with the kids and feel at home — a place that belongs to the neighborhood rather than being a chain import. Charlotte has these; they're listed below by neighborhood.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Plaza Midwood</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Common Market</strong> (2007 Commonwealth Ave): Deli / market / bar hybrid that has been Plaza Midwood's living room since 2006. Sandwiches, craft beer wall, local goods, mismatched furniture. Kid-friendly in the "bring them along and nobody blinks" sense. This is the neighborhood's anchor institution — the first place to visit to understand what Plaza Midwood actually is.</li>
          <li><strong>Moo &amp; Brew</strong>: Burgers, local beer, straightforward casual. Kid-appropriate, sports on TV, relaxed atmosphere.</li>
          <li><strong>Calle Sol</strong>: Cuban and Peruvian, casual Latin format. Empanadas, rice bowls, ceviche. Genuinely good food, kid-tolerant, accessible pricing.</li>
          <li><strong>Midwood Smokehouse</strong>: Carolina BBQ done properly with wood smoke; kid-friendly format (order at counter, family-style sides). One of Charlotte's best BBQ spots and a reliable go-to with kids in tow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dilworth</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dilworth Neighborhood Grille</strong>: A classic bar and grill that has been a neighborhood anchor for decades — explicitly family-friendly during the day and evening, and feels like it belongs to the neighborhood rather than being a chain import. Burgers, salads, comfort food. The right call for a low-key weeknight with the kids.</li>
          <li><strong>300 East</strong> (East Blvd): Contemporary American, family-run, patio seating. A step up from pure casual — the kind of restaurant where you feel like you're having a real dinner while still being comfortable with kids in tow.</li>
          <li><strong>Bakersfield</strong>: Tacos and margaritas, lively atmosphere, fast-casual Mexican. Fine with kids at lunch; more adult-bar territory in the evenings.</li>
          <li><strong>Sunflour Baking Company</strong>: Neighborhood bakery / lunch spot with excellent sandwiches and scratch pastries. The "Saturday morning with the kids" destination in Dilworth.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>South End (bikeable from Dilworth)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bartaco</strong>: Well-executed accessible tacos with good margaritas. Always kid-friendly; the kind of place where the kids can order quesadillas while adults eat well. Multiple Charlotte locations but South End is closest to target neighborhoods.</li>
          <li><strong>South End development corridor:</strong> New restaurants continue opening at pace along the South End light rail corridor — worth checking current options when you arrive, as the landscape shifts faster than any research can track.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Myers Park / Providence Rd Area</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>LittleSpoon Eatery</strong>: Popular brunch spot with a genuinely family-friendly atmosphere — full of strollers on weekend mornings. Well-executed breakfast and lunch.</li>
          <li><strong>Reid's Fine Foods</strong>: Specialty grocer and deli with an excellent prepared foods counter, charcuterie, and curated local / regional products. Worth knowing for elevated lunch and dinner planning.</li>
          <li><strong>Various Providence Road options:</strong> A 5-minute drive from Myers Park opens a full dining corridor — casual to upscale, diverse formats.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>NoDa</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boudreaux's</strong>: Louisiana Cajun and Creole food; excellent gumbo; neighborhood institution since 1999. The kind of place that has outlasted dozens of trend restaurants because the food is genuinely good and the format works.</li>
          <li><strong>NoDa Brewing</strong>: Taproom with food trucks and a family-tolerant atmosphere — bringing kids to the taproom in the early evening is totally normal in Charlotte's brewery culture.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- DATE NIGHT -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Date Night — Drive-Worthy Restaurants</h2>
    <p>Charlotte's best date-night restaurants require a car but are worth the drive. The top tier is legitimately impressive — James Beard–caliber cooking, not just by regional standards.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Top Tier (reservation required)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Supperland</strong> (Plaza Midwood): A converted church housing a Southern steakhouse with beautiful design, excellent cocktails, and food that has made multiple "best new restaurant" lists. One of Charlotte's most acclaimed restaurants — the kind of place you take visitors to impress them with what Charlotte has become. Walkable from Plaza Midwood and Commonwealth.</li>
          <li><strong>Kindred</strong> (Davidson, NC — 20 min north): James Beard Award nominee for Best Chef Southeast; New American tasting and a la carte menus in a small Davidson storefront. Consistently considered one of the best restaurants in the Carolinas. Worth the drive for a special occasion — this is the level of dining that makes Charlotte's region credible as a food destination.</li>
          <li><strong>Haberdish</strong> (NoDa): Southern Living top-10 restaurant; mill town Southern cuisine executed with real creativity and skill. Fried chicken, biscuits, and seasonal vegetables done at a high level. The kind of restaurant that makes Charlotte food worth paying attention to.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Uptown / Special Occasion</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Haymaker</strong> (Uptown, Kimpton Cardinal Hotel): Modern American in a genuinely beautiful hotel restaurant setting; business-travel crowd but not stuffy. Good for a dinner before or after a work event.</li>
          <li><strong>The Asbury</strong> (Uptown): Modern Southern; a hotel restaurant that consistently exceeds hotel restaurant expectations. Well-regarded by Charlotte food critics.</li>
          <li><strong>Nuvole</strong> (Uptown): Rooftop Italian with good views of the city — excellent for warm evenings and special occasions where atmosphere is part of the meal.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Neighborhood Date Night</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bardo</strong> (Elizabeth): Farm-to-table, seasonally driven; well-regarded; has the neighborhood-restaurant feel of a true date-night spot rather than a scene-y destination. The kind of place you return to every few months.</li>
          <li><strong>Soul Gastrolounge</strong> (Plaza Midwood): Tapas and sushi bar, upscale casual, excellent cocktail program, evening vibe. Good for the nights when you want something between casual and formal — the "actually we want a real drink and interesting food but don't need a 2-hour tasting menu" option.</li>
          <li><strong>Vana</strong> (South End): Vegetable-forward fine dining; ambitious and well-executed. Charlotte's contribution to the nationally trending upscale vegetable restaurant format.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Worth the Drive</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Kindred</strong> (Davidson): Already mentioned above — this is the one where you plan the babysitter a week in advance and make a night of it.</li>
          <li><strong>Unknown Brewing / Resident Culture / Sycamore Brewing</strong>: For an elevated brewery date rather than a restaurant — Charlotte's best craft breweries are worth knowing as casual evening destinations.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- BBQ -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>BBQ — A Charlotte Priority</h2>
    <p>Carolina BBQ is a distinct regional tradition and one of Charlotte's genuine culinary strengths. The style is typically pork-forward, wood-smoked, and served with a vinegar-based sauce (Eastern style) or a tomato-vinegar hybrid (Western / Lexington style). Worth exploring early — it's a real regional food culture.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Midwood Smokehouse</strong> (Plaza Midwood + multiple locations): Wood-smoked, genuine barbecue; accessible quality; kid-friendly format. Multiple Charlotte locations. Consistently good, unpretentious, worth making a habit of early on.</li>
      <li><strong>Sweet Lew's BBQ</strong> (Plaza Midwood): Wood-fired, smaller format, excellent quality — for when you want the focused BBQ experience without the volume of Midwood Smokehouse. A Plaza Midwood neighborhood treasure.</li>
      <li><strong>Mac's Speed Shop</strong> (multiple locations): Biker-culture vibes (motorcycles in the parking lot, covered outdoor patio), solid BBQ, family-tolerant atmosphere. Good for the "something different on a weekend" outing — distinctive atmosphere, solid food.</li>
      <li><strong>Sauceman's</strong> (West Charlotte): Proper Carolina pulled pork; no-frills; the purist's choice. Worth the 15-minute drive from the target neighborhoods if you want to understand what traditional Carolina BBQ is about.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- LATIN / INTERNATIONAL -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Latin American &amp; International Dining</h2>
    <p>Charlotte's Latin American food scene is genuinely strong — driven by a large and growing immigrant community, particularly from Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, Venezuela, Colombia, and Peru. This is not tourist-ized Tex-Mex; it's real regional cooking. The international diversity overall is a strength of the Charlotte dining scene that newcomers from other cities often underestimate.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Latin American</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Calle Sol</strong> (Plaza Midwood): Cuban and Peruvian; empanadas, ceviche, rice dishes, casual format. Genuinely good food at accessible prices. A frequent weeknight option for Plaza Midwood residents.</li>
          <li><strong>Bartaco</strong> (South End): Well-executed, accessible tacos across multiple regional styles. Consistent and always kid-friendly.</li>
          <li><strong>Barrio</strong> (multiple): Solid, consistent Mexican across several Charlotte locations. The reliable fallback for a good Mexican dinner without the research.</li>
          <li><strong>Para La Boca</strong> (various): Latin street food concept; worth investigating as the Charlotte scene evolves.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Korean &amp; Asian</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Seoul Food Meat Co.</strong> (multiple): Korean BBQ in a fun, interactive format. Good for a group dinner where the cooking-at-the-table element entertains kids and adults equally.</li>
          <li>Charlotte's Koreatown and broader Asian dining landscape has grown significantly and is worth exploring north of the target neighborhoods along North Tryon and the University City corridor.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Cajun / Louisiana</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Boudreaux's</strong> (NoDa): Louisiana Cajun and Creole; excellent gumbo; neighborhood institution since 1999. One of Charlotte's most authentic regional-American spots — not Southern in the Charlotte way, but Gulf South, which is its own tradition.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>What's Missing (calibrate expectations)</h3>
        <p style="margin-top: 8px;">Charlotte's international food scene is spread across the metro rather than concentrated in a single market district. Somali, Ethiopian, and Southeast Asian options exist but require driving to specific corridors (East Trade Street, Central Avenue). The concentration of interesting international dining closest to the target neighborhoods is Latin American and Korean.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- GROCERY -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Grocery &amp; Food Shopping</h2>
    <p>Grocery options matter for daily quality of life more than restaurant options for most families. Charlotte's grocery landscape is generally strong across the target neighborhoods.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Primary Grocery Options</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Harris Teeter</strong>: The dominant upscale grocery in Charlotte — found near every target neighborhood. Strong prepared foods section, good wine selection, clean stores. You will shop here most often.</li>
          <li><strong>Publix</strong>: Warm, well-run, and genuinely beloved chain. Strong bakery and deli departments. Present throughout the target neighborhoods. For families who grow up Publix, it's an institution; for newcomers, expect to be pleasantly surprised.</li>
          <li><strong>Trader Joe's</strong>: Two Charlotte locations — one near South End / Metropolitan area, one near Rea Road and SouthPark. Worth the drive for staples; lines can be long on weekends.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Specialty / Natural</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Whole Foods</strong>: Present in Charlotte (south Charlotte / SouthPark area and Uptown location). Not as conveniently located to most target neighborhoods as Harris Teeter, but accessible for a planned trip.</li>
          <li><strong>Earth Fare</strong>: Organic and natural grocery; location near Plaza Midwood corridor. Community-oriented, worth knowing if Whole Foods doesn't fit the bill.</li>
          <li><strong>Common Market</strong> (Commonwealth / Plaza Midwood): Local market / deli hybrid — curated local and regional products, craft beer wall, prepared foods, and a community-gathering function. Not a full-service grocery, but a neighborhood staple for supplemental shopping and daily essentials.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Specialty / Destination</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reid's Fine Foods</strong> (Myers Park / Randolph area): A specialty grocer with an excellent prepared foods counter, charcuterie, wine, and curated local and regional products. Worth knowing as a destination — not your everyday shop, but the one you go to for something specific and good.</li>
          <li><strong>Healthy Home Market</strong>: Independent natural and organic grocer; community-oriented; worth knowing if Earth Fare or Whole Foods doesn't hit the right note.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Farmers Markets</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Charlotte Regional Farmers Market</strong>: A permanent public market facility (state-run) on Yorkmont Rd, southwest of the target neighborhoods. Year-round; extensive produce, meat, and local goods.</li>
          <li><strong>7th Street Public Market</strong> (Elizabeth area): Urban market near Elizabeth that functions as a daily food hall and weekly market. Close to the target neighborhood cluster — relevant for Elizabeth, Chantilly, and Plaza Midwood residents.</li>
          <li><strong>Neighborhood markets:</strong> Various seasonal farmers markets operate throughout the target neighborhoods on weekends — the Freedom Park area market and Midwood Park programming both draw local producers.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <!-- CRAFT BEER -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Craft Brewery Scene</h2>
    <p>Charlotte's craft brewery scene is a genuine lifestyle amenity — multiple quality breweries with taprooms that function as casual gathering places, dog-friendly patios, and food truck programs. For a family that occasionally wants a low-key evening out that isn't a restaurant, the brewery scene fills that role.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>NoDa Brewing</strong> (NoDa): Charlotte's flagship craft brewery. Multiple award-winning beers; large taproom with family-tolerant atmosphere; the anchor of NoDa's identity as a creative/community neighborhood. Hop Drop 'n Roll IPA is the Charlotte cultural ambassador beer.</li>
      <li><strong>Resident Culture Brewing</strong> (South End): Nationally recognized; consistently excellent; beautiful taproom. The South End destination brewery.</li>
      <li><strong>Sycamore Brewing</strong> (South End): Well-regarded; family-friendly taproom; patio culture. Worth knowing as a South End anchor.</li>
      <li><strong>Unknown Brewing</strong>: Uptown-adjacent; worth visiting for a post-work taproom experience.</li>
      <li><strong>Triple C Brewing</strong>: South End; solid; good for a casual weekday evening.</li>
    </ul>

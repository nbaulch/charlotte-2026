      <p class="summary">The most family-dense neighborhood in the study, with Freedom Park half a mile away and excellent eventual high school (Myers Park High).

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Ashbrook-Clawson Village is a family-friendly neighborhood in southwest Charlotte, best known for proximity to Freedom Park and the Sugar Creek Greenway. The neighborhood features oak-shaded lots, mid-century bungalows and ranch homes, and a genuine suburban family feel. It is less urban and less "hip" than the Plaza Midwood or NoDa cluster — residents here tend to be established families, professionals, and longtime Charlotte residents.</p>
        <p>Demographics are remarkably professional: 72.9% of employed residents work as executives, managers, or professionals — suggesting a heavily educated, upper-middle-class population. Niche rates it B+ and it consistently appears on "best neighborhoods for families" lists for Charlotte. Proximity to Freedom Park is the defining asset — half a mile from 98 acres of park, a meaningful quality-of-life advantage for families with young kids.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Walkability mismatch:</strong> The neighborhood is car-dependent — no walkable coffee shops, restaurants, or grocery within the neighborhood. For a family whose stated priority includes "at least something walkable within a mile," this is a significant mismatch with the profile.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Mix of mid-century bungalows (1940s–1960s), ranch-style homes, and some vinyl-sided contemporary styles. Lot sizes are larger than in-town neighborhoods (7,500–10,000 sqft typical), meaning genuine backyard space for kids. Not architecturally distinctive on the level of Wilmore or Dilworth — homes have character but it's a more functional suburban character.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Median sale price:</strong> ~$610k–$660k (2025 data, up 8% YoY)</li>
          <li><strong>At $700k:</strong> Good purchasing power — likely to find 3–4 bed, 1,800–2,400 sqft on a real lot with genuine yard space</li>
          <li><strong>At $900k–$1.1M:</strong> Upper tier — well-updated or recently renovated homes with more space</li>
          <li>Larger lots than in-town competitors — more real yard for the same money</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (28208 zip):</strong> 388 SFH sales in 28208; median $394.75k zip-wide. Ashbrook-Clawson specifically has a higher median than the zip average suggests — expect $600k–$700k+ for quality homes in this neighborhood.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 35 — the lowest in this study. Fully car-dependent. No walkable coffee shops, restaurants, or grocery within the neighborhood core. This is a significant mismatch with the family's stated preference for at least something walkable within a mile.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>None walkable. Drive to SouthPark, Park Road area, or Plaza Midwood/South End corridor (5–10 min). Not within a mile's walk.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Harris Teeter and Publix accessible by short drive (5–8 min). No walkable grocery.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Park Road shopping area has restaurants and casual dining by car. Myers Park corridor (Providence Rd) has upscale options. Nothing walkable.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>Every daily errand requires a car. The family's coffee walk test is definitively not met here.</span></div>

        <h2><span class="icon">🎓</span> Schools</h2>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Assigned school: Sedgefield Elementary — Niche C/C+. 27% math proficiency, 22% reading proficiency — below district and state averages.</strong> The elementary school assignment is the weakest of any tier 1–2 neighborhood in the study except NoDa. Families here often pursue CMS magnet lottery or private school options for elementary. Budget accordingly.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;">The eventual high school pipeline is excellent. The weakness is concentrated at the elementary level. Families should apply for Highland Mill Montessori (7/10), Chantilly Montessori (8/10), or budget for private school from the start.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Safer than the national average across multiple sources. The professional demographic (72.9% executives/managers/professionals) and suburban character keep crime rates low. Property crime exists but at lower rates than in-town neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Families describe feeling comfortable with kids playing outside and walking to Freedom Park. The large-lot suburban fabric and residential street network create a naturally lower-crime environment. This is a genuine strength of the neighborhood relative to more urban options in this study.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park — half-mile walk:</strong> 98 acres with tennis, volleyball, soccer, basketball, baseball, 7-acre duck pond, nature museum (Discovery Place Nature), spray pad, and playgrounds. This is a major family amenity and arguably the best park access of any neighborhood in this study — it's essentially the family's backyard.</li>
          <li><strong>Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> 4-mile paved path from the neighborhood northward, connecting to the Little Sugar Creek Greenway system. The primary running and biking infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible via the Sugar Creek connection — 19.5 miles total, with extensive running and biking options heading toward NoDa or south toward the SC state line.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Freedom Park's proximity is the neighborhood's strongest argument. A 10-minute walk from your front door to 98 acres of family park is genuinely exceptional.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Walk score mismatch</h3>
        <p>Walk Score 35 means there is nothing walkable for daily coffee or casual errands. This family explicitly wants at least something walkable within a mile — Ashbrook-Clawson definitively doesn't deliver that. If this is a non-negotiable, stop here.</p>
        <h3>Bike commute length</h3>
        <p>4–5 miles at 25–35 minutes is manageable for a committed cyclist but is the least optimal Uptown bike commute in this study. On cold, rainy, or dark days, the car is the likely default — meaning traffic dependence for the daily commute.</p>
        <h3>Elementary school</h3>
        <p>Sedgefield Elementary (C rating) requires either magnet lottery success or private school planning from day one. Do not buy in Ashbrook-Clawson assuming the assigned elementary will work — have a plan before signing a purchase agreement.</p>
        <h3>Culture fit</h3>
        <p>The neighborhood's professional demographic skews more traditional in character than neighborhoods like Dilworth or Plaza Midwood. Worth assessing in person — this is a subjective judgment that matters for the "relatable neighbors" priority.</p>
        <h3>Car dependence</h3>
        <p>This is fully a car-dependent neighborhood. Two adults with a car-commuting pattern and young kids will feel the lack of walkable options more than a single-car household. Factor in the lifestyle cost of needing to drive for every errand.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Weak–Moderate.</strong> Ashbrook-Clawson Village is genuinely good for family density (most family-dense neighborhood in the study), park access (Freedom Park half a mile away is a world-class urban park), safety, and eventual high school (Myers Park High, Niche A). These are real strengths that should not be dismissed.</p>
    <p>But it significantly mismatches this family's stated priorities in two key ways: (1) Walk score of 35 — there is nothing walkable, and this family wants at least a coffee shop within a mile's walk; (2) the bike commute to Uptown is 25–35 minutes — the longest in this study. The elementary school (Sedgefield, C rating) requires alternative planning. This neighborhood works if the family is willing to fully embrace car dependence and prioritizes park access and family density over walkable urban life. It does not work if the daily coffee walk is non-negotiable. Worth driving past Freedom Park to understand that asset, but this family will likely prefer neighborhoods closer to Uptown with more walkability.</p>

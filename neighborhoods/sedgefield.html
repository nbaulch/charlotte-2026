        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Sedgefield is the sleeper neighborhood on this list — historically sitting in Dilworth's shadow, but increasingly interesting as South End development pushes values and attention southward. The neighborhood consists of roughly 492 acres of tree-lined streets with bungalow-style homes and mill-era cottages dating from the 1930s–1950s, bisected by South Boulevard's commercial corridor and bordered by the Rail Trail/greenway system.</p>
        <p>Charlotte Magazine describes Sedgefield as "sheltered" — a neighborhood that maintained its identity as surrounding areas boomed. The community has real civic backbone: in 2016, residents organized to block a proposed Pulte Homes development on school land, gathering 1,500 petition signatures. The Sedgefield Neighborhood Association hosts Sedgefest (an annual festival with live music, food trucks, and a kids' zone), and residents consistently cite the neighborhood's dog-friendly, walkable streets as draws.</p>
        <p>The demographic picture is mixed. Sedgefield has both a significant renter population (cited as 47–89% depending on boundary definition) and newer homeowners who have bought in as it appreciates. Median household income varies by source from ~$53,000 (older data) to ~$122,000 (newer estimates), reflecting rapid change. Family density is moderate — higher than Dilworth and Elizabeth but lower than Myers Park and Chantilly.</p>
        <p>Politically, Sedgefield residents are described as having "moderate political views" — this family's liberal lean may be slightly more pronounced than the neighborhood median but unlikely to feel out of place.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Sedgefield's housing stock is genuinely charming: primarily 1930s–1950s bungalows and cottages on modest lots, with some brick ranch homes. The neighborhood has both original stock (needing varying degrees of renovation) and an increasing number of renovated or rebuilt homes.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$800k:</strong> Realistic entry point for a quality renovated single-family home. A 3–4 bedroom, 1,600–2,200 sq ft bungalow with good lot space is findable.</li>
          <li><strong>$800k–$950k:</strong> Well-renovated or rebuilt 4-bedroom homes, 2,000–2,800 sq ft, possibly with expanded footprints on original lots.</li>
          <li><strong>$950k–$1.1M:</strong> Larger custom builds or substantially rebuilt homes with modern amenities in the neighborhood envelope.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026, 28209):</strong> 489 SFH sales, median $915k, 129 sales (26%) in your $700k–$1.1M range. Better inventory availability than Myers Park (10%) or Chantilly (48%). The $800k–$1M range is where you find 4bd/2,500 sqft targets.
        </div>
        <p>Charlotte Magazine profiled a Sedgefield home as "a charming 1940s cottage with natural light, generous living/dining spaces, built-in bookshelves, an updated kitchen with walk-in pantry, and beautiful hardwoods" — the character this family is looking for. Price per sq ft: ~$378, meaningfully below Dilworth ($446) and Chantilly ($524).</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 55 — Somewhat Walkable. More walkable than Myers Park but less than Dilworth or Elizabeth. The South Boulevard corridor along the neighborhood's eastern edge has a micro Walk Score of 85. Most daily errands require driving or biking to South Blvd.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Eight and Sand (South Blvd area — cafe/sandwich shop with great pastries; also does focaccia pizza on weekends), various South Blvd options within a 5-min bike ride</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Harris Teeter (anchors the Sedgefield Redevelopment on South Blvd). Publix and other options along the corridor.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>South Boulevard corridor has steady influx of restaurants — Seoul Poke Bowl (near Scaleybark rail station), Waterman (upscale). Must drive or bike to most options.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>Sedgefield's walkable amenities are tied to South Boulevard proximity. The deeper residential streets are quiet — you'll bike or drive to most daily retail. Less immediately walkable than Dilworth, but the infrastructure is a short bike ride away.</span></div>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Dilworth Elementary — Sedgefield Campus</strong> (715 Hartford Ave) serves PK–K-2. The 3–5 grades attend the Latta Campus in Dilworth proper — note the split-campus logistics. Same school district as Dilworth: 77% math proficiency, 74% reading proficiency, top 10% in NC.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Sedgefield Montessori:</strong> A public CMS Montessori magnet school is located within the neighborhood. Ranked top 6% of NC elementary schools (16th of 109 CMS elementaries). Strong diverse enrollment. This is an excellent option if assigned or via lottery. Check with CMS for specific address assignment — some Sedgefield addresses may be in the Sedgefield Montessori zone.
        </div>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Some sources indicate Dilworth Elementary is being replaced by a new Park Road Elementary for fall 2026 (affecting the Dilworth/Sedgefield zone). Verify the current elementary assignment directly with CMS before purchasing any Sedgefield property.

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>CrimeGrade ranks Sedgefield in the <strong>39th percentile for safety</strong> — safer than 39% of US neighborhoods. Violent crime rate: ~5.2 per 1,000 residents/year, which is above the national average. The assault crime ranking is in the 31st percentile.</p>
        <p>Context: Sedgefield's numbers partially reflect South Boulevard's commercial/bar character (restaurant corridors attract property crime). The residential streets feel safe; issues tend to be concentrated along commercial corridors. Not alarming, but meaningfully below Myers Park (92nd percentile) and Chantilly (crime 42% below national avg).</p>
        <p>For a family with young children, this warrants some consideration — particularly for properties closest to South Boulevard. Interior residential blocks are safer than the statistics suggest.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Directly accessible from Sedgefield via the Sedgefield Park trail junction — a specifically developed connection allowing Sedgefield residents to reach the greenway without crossing major roads. The primary running and biking infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> ~2 miles from Sedgefield's center — a short bike ride. 98 acres, 7-acre lake, playgrounds, spray pad, dog park, tennis. Not walking distance but genuinely close.</li>
          <li><strong>Sedgefield Neighborhood Park (Butterfly Park):</strong> Small neighborhood park with playground, tennis courts, picnic areas, and walking/biking paths. Hosts Sedgefest.</li>
          <li><strong>Rail Trail / Charlotte Rail Trail:</strong> Runs near South Boulevard, connecting toward South End and Uptown.</li>

        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Renter-heavy character</h3>
        <p>The neighborhood's high renter percentage means more turnover and potentially less of the stable-neighbor community this family wants. The transition toward homeownership is happening — Sedgefield Redevelopment and appreciation are attracting owner-occupants — but this remains a real consideration vs. Chantilly's 70% homeownership.</p>
        <h3>Development / gentrification</h3>
        <p>The Sedgefield Redevelopment project along South Boulevard has delivered four major phases (retail, 263 apartments, 118k sq ft office, 166 apartments as of mid-2024). This improves walkable amenities and neighborhood vitality, but raises prices and could change the residential character of quieter streets over time.</p>
        <h3>Flood risk</h3>
        <p>Little Sugar Creek runs near Sedgefield's eastern edge and has flood history. The Sedgefield Park trail junction sits adjacent to creek areas. Specific streets closer to the creek corridor should be flood-zone verified via FEMA Flood Map Service Center before purchase. Not a whole-neighborhood issue.</p>
        <h3>School assignment</h3>
        <p>Verify current elementary assignment directly with CMS — the Dilworth Elementary restructuring (Park Road Elementary opening fall 2026) may affect the Sedgefield zone. Sedgefield Montessori magnet is a strong local option.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate.</strong> Sedgefield offers this family the best price-to-character ratio for housing stock: 1930s–1950s bungalows with genuine design character at prices where $800k–$1M actually buys a 4-bedroom home with outdoor space. The greenway bike commute to Uptown is solid (~15–20 min), the schools are strong (Dilworth Elementary or Sedgefield Montessori), and the neighborhood has community spirit (Sedgefest, active neighborhood association).</p>
    <p>The concerns are real: moderate-elevated crime relative to Myers Park/Chantilly, a higher renter proportion reducing the stable-neighbor feel, and lower family density (~22% with kids). Sedgefield is best described as "up and coming with real upside." If the family is comfortable being part of a neighborhood in transition — and would help build the community they want rather than stepping into an established one — Sedgefield is a genuine contender. If they need the community to already be there, Chantilly or Myers Park serve better. Worth including in any house-hunting visit to compare what $850k gets you here vs. the tier 1 neighborhoods.</p>

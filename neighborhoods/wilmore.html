        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Wilmore is one of Charlotte's oldest neighborhoods — a 1930s construction boom left it with craftsman bungalows, small cottages, and early-20th-century character. It sits between South End and Uptown, making it extremely convenient but also meaning it has absorbed significant development pressure over the past decade. The LYNX Blue Line light rail runs accessible to the neighborhood, making car-free Uptown commuting viable. Median age is 28 — notably young, with a strong renter presence.</p>
        <p>Wilmore is in rapid transformation. Character homes on original blocks are being joined by new construction townhomes at rising price points. Both established families and a strong young-professional and renter presence coexist. Residents describe a "quintessential neighborhood feel" with friendly neighbors, while also noting significant ongoing construction activity. Politically leans liberal, consistent with adjacent South End and Dilworth.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>The commute case:</strong> Wilmore may have the best overall commute profile of any neighborhood on this list — excellent bike access to Uptown (~10–15 min), LYNX Blue Line transit access, and among the shorter drives to the I-85 N corridor for the Winston-Salem commute. If commute convenience is a high-weight factor, Wilmore warrants serious attention.

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Primarily 1920s–1940s bungalows and cottages on modest lots, with infill townhomes increasingly present on formerly vacant or demolished lots. Original character homes are charming but small — finding a 4-bed/2,500 sqft home in original stock is genuinely difficult. The family should go in knowing this is a neighborhood where they'll likely be choosing between character and square footage.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$800k:</strong> Renovated 3-bed bungalow with modern updates, or a newer townhome — probably 1,600–2,000 sqft. Charming but potentially tight for a WFH family.</li>
          <li><strong>$800k–$1.1M:</strong> Better options open up — potentially 3–4 bed with more space, though a true 4-bed with meaningful backyard requires careful searching and patience.</li>
          <li><strong>Key concern:</strong> Many upper-budget homes are new construction townhomes — exactly the cookie-cutter product this family wants to avoid. The genuinely character-filled original homes at family-appropriate size are scarce and competed for.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026, 28203):</strong> 28203 zip covers Dilworth and Wilmore combined — 318 SFH sales total, median $926k, 97 sales (31%) in the $700k–$1.1M budget. Wilmore's neighborhood median (~$725k, July 2025) is lower than Dilworth's, reflecting its smaller homes and more variable stock. Wilmore-specific homes are at the accessible end of this zip's price range.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 58. Bike score also 58 — Irwin Creek Greenway runs along the western edge, connecting toward Uptown. South End's rail trail is within reach. The LYNX Blue Line access is a genuine lifestyle asset for car-light living.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Summit Coffee has a Wilmore-area location. South End's coffeeshops (multiple — Not Just Coffee, Summit, others) are a short walk or bike ride and represent the primary walkable coffee option.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Limited walkable grocery within Wilmore itself — residents drive 5–10 min to South End area Publix or Harris Teeter. This is a minor gap compared to Dilworth's in-neighborhood Harris Teeter.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>South End's restaurant corridor is within walking and biking distance — one of Charlotte's best and most active dining scenes. Within Wilmore itself, options are more limited. Think: 5-minute bike to South End for dinner, 5-minute walk for coffee.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>The "coffee within a mile" threshold is met via South End proximity, though not from inside the neighborhood itself. More like Chantilly's relationship to Plaza Midwood than Dilworth's own East Blvd scene.</span></div>

        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>The school assignment is Wilmore's most compelling attribute.</strong> If a Wilmore address still feeds Dilworth Elementary after the 2026 restructuring, this is a genuine reason to consider Wilmore seriously. Also available via magnet lottery: Sedgefield Montessori (top 6% NC). See <a href="../schools/index.html">Schools overview</a> for magnet details.

        <h2><span class="icon">🚲</span> Commute</h2>
        <h3>His commute to Uptown (100 N Tryon St)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bike:</strong> ~1.5–2.5 miles; approximately <strong>10–15 minutes</strong>. Irwin Creek Greenway connects toward the Uptown CycleLink. Excellent bike commute — potentially the best distance-to-time ratio on this list after Plaza Midwood.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> 5–8 minutes in normal conditions.</li>
          <li><strong>LYNX Blue Line:</strong> Accessible — Uptown is 2–3 stops. A real alternative for bad weather days.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Her commute to Wake Forest / Winston-Salem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> ~75–90 minutes. Wilmore's location near I-277 and I-85 access makes this one of the better-positioned neighborhoods for her westbound commute to Winston-Salem. Potentially the fastest Winston-Salem commute time of any neighborhood on this list due to proximity to the I-85 N on-ramp without traversing Uptown.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>AreaVibes estimates Wilmore crime approximately <strong>281% above national average</strong>, with violent crime approximately <strong>162% above national average</strong>. These are notable figures — among the highest of any neighborhood on this list.</p>
        <p>Important context: These are AreaVibes FBI-estimate extrapolations for an urban neighborhood immediately adjacent to South End's entertainment corridor and the I-277 corridor. They may overcount commercial-zone incidents. Resident perspective is more nuanced: families regularly walk with strollers, and residents describe friendly neighbors on their specific residential streets. However, adjacency to South End nightlife and major transit corridors means property crime — car break-ins, catalytic converter theft, theft from vehicles — is meaningfully more common than in purely residential neighborhoods like Chantilly or Sedgefield.</p>
        <p>This is a real concern, not dismissible. A site visit at different times of day, including evening, is strongly recommended.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Irwin Creek Greenway:</strong> Runs along Wilmore's western edge, connecting toward the Stewart Creek system and ultimately toward Uptown. His primary bike commute infrastructure and running route from the neighborhood.</li>
          <li><strong>Rail Trail / South End:</strong> The 3.5-mile Rail Trail connecting South End to Uptown begins within reach of Wilmore — one of Charlotte's most popular active corridors, with murals, restaurants, and heavy use on weekends.</li>
          <li><strong>Abbott Park:</strong> Playground, athletic field, basketball courts — in-neighborhood park for everyday family use.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> ~1.5–2 miles south by bike; 98 acres with lake, spray pad, dog park, tennis, kayaking. More accessible from Wilmore than from Plaza Midwood or NoDa.</li>
          <li><strong>Latta Park (Dilworth):</strong> 31-acre park with spray pad, playgrounds, tennis — accessible by short bike ride through adjacent Dilworth.</li>

        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Crime statistics</h3>
        <p>Elevated relative to Charlotte norms — the most significant concern for this neighborhood. Worth a site visit at multiple times of day and a direct conversation with current Wilmore residents (check Reddit r/Charlotte for recent resident perspectives). Not necessarily dangerous on residential streets, but the statistics are real and represent a meaningful difference from Chantilly's crime rate below national average.</p>
        <h3>Development and infill</h3>
        <p>Wilmore is actively transforming with new construction townhomes replacing character homes on many blocks. The right buy in Wilmore is a <em>specific property</em> — an original craftsman bungalow with real lot space — not just the neighborhood. Be selective. Cookie-cutter new construction exists here at high prices alongside genuine character homes.</p>
        <h3>Flood risk</h3>
        <p>Irwin Creek and associated creek corridors near Wilmore create flood risk on some blocks. Check FEMA Flood Map Service Center at address-level before any offer. Hurricane Helene (2024) demonstrated widespread flooding throughout Charlotte's creek corridors.</p>
        <h3>Airport noise</h3>
        <p>Wilmore's location in the southwest quadrant, closer to CLT than most in-town neighborhoods, means somewhat higher airplane noise potential than neighborhoods east of Uptown. Worth testing during a site visit — stand outside at the address for 15 minutes and assess. Not reported as a major issue by residents but worth confirming for the specific street.</p>
        <h3>School transition</h3>
        <p>The Fall 2026 Park Road Elementary restructuring may affect Wilmore addresses. Confirm current assignment directly with CMS — do not rely on any source other than the official CMS school finder at cmsk12.org. This is the most critical due diligence step before committing to a Wilmore purchase.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate.</strong> Wilmore has a compelling commute story — excellent bike access to Uptown (~10–15 min, greenway-connected), LYNX Blue Line transit, and one of the shorter Winston-Salem drive times of any neighborhood on this list. The school assignment (Dilworth Elementary, top 10% NC) is Wilmore's most compelling attribute — if it holds after the 2026 restructuring, it's a genuinely strong outcome. And the housing stock, when you find the right specific home, has real character.</p>
    <p>The downsides are meaningful: crime statistics are elevated relative to Charlotte norms; the housing stock at family-appropriate size (3–4 bed, 2,500 sqft with real backyard) is limited and competes with new construction townhomes that don't fit this family's style; and family density is lower than in Chantilly, Myers Park, or Sedgefield. Median age of 28 signals a younger, more renter-heavy community than this family is seeking.</p>
    <p>If the family finds a genuinely charming renovated bungalow — original character, real lot, backyard space — at $850k–$1.1M, and the Dilworth Elementary assignment is confirmed, Wilmore could work well. But this requires finding the right specific property, not just landing in the neighborhood, and doing the school assignment due diligence before any offer. A Moderate fit, not a Strong one — worth keeping on the list if a compelling specific home appears, but not a neighborhood to buy into on spec.</p>

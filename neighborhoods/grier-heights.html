      <h1>Grier Heights</h1>
      <p class="summary">One of Charlotte's oldest African American neighborhoods, founded in the 1890s when Sam Billings — a formerly enslaved man — made the first recorded African American land purchase in the city. Directly across Randolph Road from Eastover, zoned for Myers Park High (A-rated). Deep community identity, but very high crime, low walkability, and an active gentrification struggle make it a poor fit for this family's specific profile.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Grier Heights has one of the deepest historical identities of any Charlotte neighborhood. Founded in the 1890s when Sam Billings purchased 100 acres — the first recorded African American land purchase in Charlotte — it grew significantly in the 1940s when <strong>Arthur Samuel Grier</strong>, a prominent Black funeral-home director, built 100 homes for Black servicemen returning from WWII. The neighborhood served as home to teachers, masons, postal workers, and middle-class Black families for over a century.</p>
        <p>Today, Grier Heights sits directly across Randolph Road from Eastover — one of Charlotte's wealthiest enclaves — creating one of the starkest socioeconomic contrasts in the city. Median household income is $38k (21% below NC average). Active community organizations include CrossRoads Corporation, Grier Heights Community Improvement Organization, and partnerships with United Way and Habitat Charlotte Region.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Gentrification tension:</strong> Grier Heights is under significant development pressure due to its location (adjacent to Eastover, zoned for Myers Park High, 2 miles from Uptown). Axios Charlotte described it as "nearing a tipping point." DreamKey Partners has been approved for $4.8M in mixed-income development (289 units). Myers Park Presbyterian Church awarded $1 million to help existing residents stay. Long-term residents are being displaced as investor purchases and rental conversions erode owner-occupancy. The family would be arriving in the middle of an active displacement struggle — this carries real social and ethical dimensions.

        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Mix of older single-family homes (1940s–1970s), some renovated properties, and planned new mixed-income development. The housing stock is modest — original homes are typically smaller ranch-style on moderate lots.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$230k–$330k:</strong> Median range — older, unrenovated single-family home</li>
          <li><strong>$400k–$800k:</strong> Renovated or new construction — well above the neighborhood median</li>
          <li><strong>$700k–$1.1M:</strong> Your budget buys the absolute top of this market. Very few properties at this price point exist — you'd be buying/building the most expensive home in the neighborhood.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (28207 zip):</strong> Grier Heights shares the 28207 zip with Myers Park and Eastover. The $2.0M zip median is driven entirely by those luxury neighborhoods — Grier Heights itself has a median around $230k–$330k, a completely different market. Volatile pricing: down 36% YoY in Nov 2025 but up in earlier months, reflecting a thin market with investor activity.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;">The <strong>Myers Park High</strong> zoning is the neighborhood's strongest academic asset — it's consistently rated among the best public high schools in CMS (Niche A+, GreatSchools 7/10). <strong>Alexander Graham Middle</strong> also rates well. The elementary split (Billingsville K-2, Cotswold 3-5) is unusual but both are established CMS schools.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>School pipeline is a genuine strength.</strong> Myers Park High zoning from a $300k–$800k neighborhood is rare — most families paying $1.5M+ in Myers Park proper get the same high school. CMS boundary changes are ongoing, so verify 2026-27 assignments with a specific address.

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>AreaVibes rates crime at <strong>365% above the national average</strong> — the highest of any neighborhood in this study. CAP Index crime score: 9/10 (national average: 4). Safety ranking: 92nd in Charlotte. Livability ranking: #151 in Charlotte, better than only 8% of areas.</p>
        <p>This is the most significant concern for this neighborhood. The statistics are elevated across both property and violent crime categories. Multiple community organizations are actively working on safety improvement, and investment in the area may reduce crime over time — but current numbers are notably high.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Grier Heights Park:</strong> Community park at 3120 Leroy St with walking trails, baseball field, and open green space. Neighborhood-scale, not a destination park.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> Accessible 1–2 miles west via Randolph Road through Myers Park/Eastover — Charlotte's premier 98-acre family park.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible via Freedom Park connection. Not directly within the neighborhood — requires crossing Randolph Road.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Greenway and park infrastructure is adequate but not a neighborhood strength. Freedom Park proximity via Eastover is a plus, though accessing it requires navigating through another neighborhood.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Highest crime in the study</h3>
        <p>At 365% above national average, Grier Heights has the most elevated crime statistics of any neighborhood researched. This is the primary disqualifying factor for a family with young children.</p>
        <h3>Active displacement struggle</h3>
        <p>Grier Heights is in the middle of an active gentrification and displacement struggle. Long-term Black residents are being pushed out by rising costs and investor purchases. Multiple community organizations and nonprofits are working to keep existing residents in place. A family arriving with a $700k+ budget would be part of the gentrification dynamic — this carries real social implications worth considering carefully.</p>
        <h3>Thin housing market</h3>
        <p>The $230k–$330k median means your $700k–$1.1M budget would make you the most expensive homeowner on the block. The market is thin and volatile — price swings of 30%+ year-over-year reflect a small number of sales driven by speculation. This is not a stable real estate market.</p>
        <h3>Car dependence</h3>
        <p>Walk Score 43, Bike Score 33. No walkable coffee, dining, or grocery. The "at least a coffee shop within a mile" threshold is not met.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Weak–Moderate.</strong> Grier Heights has a genuinely compelling draw: <strong>Myers Park High School zoning</strong> from a neighborhood where median homes cost $230k–$330k. That school access — the same pipeline that families in $2M+ Myers Park enjoy — is a rare value proposition. The neighborhood's deep historical identity (130+ years of community) and active improvement organizations show real community infrastructure.</p>
    <p>But the fit for this specific family is poor on multiple dimensions: (1) crime is the highest of any neighborhood studied (365% above national average); (2) walkability fails their coffee-within-a-mile threshold (Walk Score 43); (3) the housing market is thin and volatile — their budget makes them extreme outliers; (4) the active gentrification and displacement dynamics create social complexity that goes beyond typical neighborhood considerations. If Myers Park High zoning is the priority, the adjacent areas of Sedgefield or the budget edge of Myers Park itself achieve it without these complications. Grier Heights is included for geographic completeness and to acknowledge its historical significance — it is not recommended as a primary target for this family.</p>

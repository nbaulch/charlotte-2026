        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Myers Park is Charlotte's most prestigious residential neighborhood — a 1910s streetcar suburb designed with grand boulevards, towering oak canopies, Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival architecture. Queens Road West is its signature street: a divided boulevard with a median of mature trees and a parade of large historic homes.</p>
        <p>This is Charlotte's equivalent of Minneapolis's Kenwood or Lowry Hill — established, beautiful, architecturally significant, and quite affluent. Median household income in 28207 is ~$230,000. The community skews conservative by Charlotte standards (Niche notes "residents tend to lean conservative"), is overwhelmingly white (91%), and carries an old-money, established reputation. Not pretentious in a nouveau-riche way — more old Charlotte families who've been here for generations.</p>
        <p>For this family from Lynnhurst, the architecture and aesthetics are appealing, but the <strong>social culture may feel different</strong>: Myers Park is more conservative, more formal, and has a certain established-wealth gravitas that Lynnhurst doesn't. You would be entering as younger transplants into an expensive neighborhood. Worth assessing in person.</p>
        <p><strong>31% of households have children</strong> — the highest family density of any neighborhood on this list. Families with young kids are a core demographic here.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Myers Park is dominated by grand Colonial Revival, Tudor, Georgian, and Mediterranean estates on sweeping lots. These are large, formal homes — architecturally significant but formal/grand rather than casual/cozy bungalow character.</p>
        <h3>The budget reality</h3>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Your $700k–$1.1M budget buys the very bottom of Myers Park.</strong> The median is ~$2.0M (county parcel data, 2024–2026). At $586/sqft, $1M buys approximately 1,700 sqft — very small by neighborhood standards. True 4-bedroom single-family homes with 2,500 sqft typically start at $1.5M+.
        </div>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$900k:</strong> Very limited inventory. 2–3 bedroom condo, townhome, or very modest/dated SFH needing renovation. Not the 4bd/2,500 sqft family home you want.</li>
          <li><strong>$900k–$1.1M:</strong> Older 3–4bd homes (1,500–2,200 sqft) on smaller lots, original 1940s–1960s character. Some renovation projects. Possible entry point.</li>
          <li><strong>In-budget sales:</strong> County data shows only 21 of 201 SFH sales (10%) in the 28207 zip were in your $700k–$1.1M range.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Assessment:</strong> Myers Park is worth exploring for schools and safety, but realistic about budget. If a specific property surfaces at budget, assess it seriously. Otherwise, focus on Dilworth/Sedgefield/Chantilly where budget buys more appropriate homes.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 43 — Car-Dependent. Myers Park is beautiful but was designed for cars (the original streetcars no longer run). Most errands require driving.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Higher Grounds by Manolo's (inside Myers Park United Methodist Church — community gathering spot), The People's Market (2820 Selwyn Ave — all-day cafe, community institution), Detour Coffeebar nearby</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Harris Teeter (1015 Providence Rd) — strong anchor within neighborhood retail corridor. Reid's Fine Foods (specialty grocer and beloved local institution). Drive to most options.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>LittleSpoon Eatery (popular brunch), various Selwyn Ave options. Must drive to most restaurants.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>This is a driving neighborhood for daily errands. Some addresses near Selwyn Ave have walkable options, but most of Myers Park requires a car for coffee and groceries. A departure from the family's Lynnhurst walkability.</span></div>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Selwyn Elementary</strong> is Charlotte's gold standard public elementary: 85% math proficiency, 79% reading proficiency, ranked 29th elementary school in North Carolina (98th percentile statewide). 618 students. The three schools (Selwyn/Alexander Graham/Myers Park High) share a 120-acre wooded campus — a genuinely unique and appealing attribute.</p>
        <p>Some Myers Park addresses are zoned to <strong>Eastover Elementary</strong> instead (10/10 GreatSchools) — verify your specific address. Both feed into the same middle/high pipeline.</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Some 28207 addresses may also feed into Sedgefield Middle rather than Alexander Graham — verify at cmsk12.org.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🚲</span> Commute</h2>
        <h3>His commute to Uptown (100 N Tryon St)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bike:</strong> ~3.5–4.5 miles, approximately <strong>18–25 minutes</strong>. Little Sugar Creek Greenway along Freedom Park's western edge provides an off-road route to the Uptown CycleLink at 7th Street. Well within his comfort zone. The "Booty Loop" roads (Queens Road) are also popular with cyclists.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> 10–15 minutes in normal conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Her commute to Wake Forest / Winston-Salem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> ~1 hr 35–45 min. Myers Park sits south-southeast of Uptown. Getting to I-85 North requires navigating north through or around Uptown — adds meaningful time vs. north/central neighborhoods. On bad traffic days this can push toward 1:45–1:50. One of the less favorable commutes for her.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Myers Park is <strong>the safest neighborhood on this entire list</strong>. CrimeGrade ranks it in the <strong>92nd percentile for safety</strong> — safer than 92% of US neighborhoods. Violent crime: ~1.96 per 1,000 residents/year (well below national average of ~4). Property crime also low by Charlotte standards.</p>
        <p>For a family with young children, Myers Park's safety profile is among its strongest selling points. Kids playing outside, walking to school, biking in the neighborhood — all feel genuinely safe here.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> Immediately adjacent to Myers Park's northern boundary — 98 acres, 7-acre lake, 2 playgrounds, spray pad, dog park, 4 baseball fields, kayaking, bandshell. Arguably the best urban family park in Charlotte. Walking distance from much of Myers Park.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Runs along Freedom Park's west side, accessible from multiple Myers Park trailheads.</li>
          <li><strong>Queens Road West as running infrastructure:</strong> The divided boulevard is beloved by Charlotte runners and cyclists. Many people drive to Myers Park specifically to run this route — beautiful, shaded, light traffic.</li>
          <li><strong>Briar Creek Greenway:</strong> Runs through areas near Myers Park's east side.</li>

        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>CLT flight path — significant risk</h3>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Myers Park was specifically named</strong> in Charlotte news coverage of the proposed 2024 CLT flight path expansion. The City Council approved studying new departure routes (tripling from 8 to 27 paths), pending FAA approval. Myers Park, not currently affected, could see new aircraft noise if approved. Timeline: 1+ year for FAA review. Monitor closely.
        </div>
        <h3>Culture fit</h3>
        <p>Myers Park's community skews conservative and old-Charlotte. Multiple sources note the "established wealth" social dynamics. This family should visit in person and gauge whether the social culture feels like a fit — specifically whether they'd feel comfortable as younger transplant professionals in a neighborhood defined by old-Charlotte families.</p>
        <h3>Budget realism</h3>
        <p>Unless you're willing to start with a smaller/older home and potentially upgrade later, Myers Park's market doesn't align with your budget for the home type you want. Don't get attached to the neighborhood until you've verified what $900k–$1.1M actually buys on Zillow/Redfin.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate (Budget-Constrained).</strong> Myers Park is the objectively "best" Charlotte neighborhood by conventional family metrics: top-ranked schools (Selwyn Elementary is NC top 5%), highest family density (31% households with kids), Freedom Park at the doorstep, exceptional safety (92nd percentile), and beautiful historic architecture. If budget weren't a constraint, it would be a very strong fit.</p>
    <p>But budget is a constraint. The median home price is ~$2.0M. Your $700k–$1.1M range gets only 10% of recent sales — and those are modest/smaller homes at the bottom of the market, not the 4bd/2,500 sqft character home you want. To get the full Myers Park experience, budget realistically starts at $1.3M–$1.5M+.</p>
    <p>The second consideration: Myers Park's social culture skews conservative and old-Charlotte, which may feel different from Lynnhurst's liberal, open community. Visit and assess in person before committing emotionally to the neighborhood. If it clicks culturally and you find a specific property in budget that works, pursue it — the schools and safety are genuinely excellent. If not, Chantilly or Dilworth will serve this family better.</p>

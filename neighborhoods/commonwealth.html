        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Commonwealth is the quieter residential neighborhood immediately east of Plaza Midwood, sharing the 28205 zip code. Best understood as Plaza Midwood's residential backyard — craftsman homes, tree-lined streets, and a more family-oriented demographic than Plaza Midwood's busy commercial corridor. Niche gives it an <strong>A- overall</strong> and rates it 4.0/4 for family-friendliness. Residents tend to be upper-middle-class professionals; politics lean liberal.</p>
        <p>Think: weekend walks to Veterans Park, kids riding bikes on tree-lined streets, the short walk to Common Market for a coffee and a sandwich. The neighborhood has the bones and community culture of Plaza Midwood but with the volume turned down — fewer bars, less foot traffic, more front-porch-and-wave energy.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Naming note:</strong> "Commonwealth" is also the name of the massive new 12-acre mixed-use development at 1710 Commonwealth Ave (within Plaza Midwood territory). The residential <em>neighborhood</em> of Commonwealth predates this development entirely — it refers to the historic single-family home area along Commonwealth Avenue and surrounding residential streets east of Plaza Midwood's commercial core.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Primarily craftsman bungalows and four-squares from the 1920s–1940s, similar in style to Plaza Midwood but with less commercial pressure and more residential consistency block to block. Character homes are common — original hardwoods, built-ins, front porches, mature landscaping.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$750k–$875k:</strong> 3–4 bed, 1,600–2,000 sqft, many with character updates. The realistic entry point for a well-maintained bungalow.</li>
          <li><strong>$875k–$1.1M:</strong> Better 3–4 bed options with more space and more thorough renovations, 1,800–2,200 sqft. At the upper end, 4-bed homes become achievable.</li>
          <li><strong>Days on market: ~23 days</strong> — significantly more competitive than Plaza Midwood's current 66-day average. Good homes move fast.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Lot sizes are modest — typically 5,000–7,500 sqft, similar to Plaza Midwood. Expect decks and small-to-medium backyards rather than large grass lots. Comparable to the current Lynnhurst home lot size.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026, 28205):</strong> Combined zip data (Plaza Midwood/Commonwealth/Plaza Hills): 928 SFH sales, median $637.5k, 256 sales (28%) in budget. Commonwealth's neighborhood-specific median is higher than the zip average — approximately $755k–$877k. Very limited inventory: only 2–3 homes for sale at any given time. When a good home comes up, it goes fast — 23-day average DOM.

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 66 — a step above Plaza Midwood's aggregate score. Commonwealth residents are within walking distance of Plaza Midwood's restaurant and coffee scene on Central Avenue, and Common Market and Undercurrent Coffee are both within the neighborhood itself on Commonwealth Ave.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Common Market (2007 Commonwealth Ave — coffee, deli, beer, local institution with patio), Undercurrent Coffee (2012 Commonwealth Ave — excellent specialty roaster, the Jones Coffee analog), Summit Coffee (short walk into Plaza Midwood)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Earth Fare (short drive or longer walk), Publix accessible; no full-service grocery within walking distance is a minor gap</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Full access to Plaza Midwood's restaurant scene within 5–10 min walk — Supperland, Soul Gastrolounge, Sweet Lew's BBQ, Moo &amp; Brew, Calle Sol, and dozens of others. Common Market itself is a casual lunch/dinner destination.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>Commonwealth threads a needle: you get the walkable coffee/dining scene without living directly on the commercial corridor. The "coffee within a mile" bar is definitively cleared.</span></div>

        <h2><span class="icon">🎓</span> Schools</h2>
        <p>Same zone considerations apply as Plaza Midwood — assigned school varies by specific address. The strongest strategies involve CMS magnet applications.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Verify your specific address at cmsk12.org before buying.</strong> Like Plaza Midwood, Commonwealth addresses can feed into schools of significantly varying quality. The magnet lottery path is the recommended primary strategy — do not rely on the assigned attendance-zone school without confirming its current rating.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;font-size:0.9rem;"><strong>Highland Mill Montessori</strong> (3201 Clemson Ave): public magnet, GreatSchools 7/10, Niche A, 87% math / 77% reading proficiency — the primary target via fall 2026 CMS lottery for 2027–28 Kindergarten. <strong>Chantilly Montessori</strong> (8/10 GreatSchools) is a second strong magnet option.</p>
        <p style="font-size:0.9rem;"><strong>Myers Park High</strong> (Niche A) is the likely high school assignment for most Commonwealth addresses via the Myers Park feeder pattern — a genuinely strong outcome.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🚲</span> Commute</h2>
        <h3>His commute to Uptown (100 N Tryon St)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bike:</strong> ~2–2.5 miles via Little Sugar Creek Greenway to the Uptown CycleLink connection at 7th Street; approximately <strong>12–18 minutes</strong>. A comfortable and well-connected route.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> 8–10 minutes in normal conditions.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Her commute to Wake Forest / Winston-Salem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> ~80–90 minutes via I-277 to I-85 N. Access from Commonwealth is straightforward — similar timing to Plaza Midwood. On a 2-day/week campus schedule, very manageable.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Commonwealth is safer than the national average across multiple sources. Niche gives strong safety marks. The residential character — less through traffic, no commercial bar corridor — means lower property crime than Plaza Midwood's Central Avenue zone.</p>
        <p>Resident reviews consistently describe it as safe for families — stroller-walking, kids on bikes, leaving windows open. The demographic stability (homeowners, families, long-term residents) contributes to the sense of safety. No specific crime incidents of note in recent sources.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> The primary trail running north-south through the area — connects south to Freedom Park (13.7+ miles to Pineville), north to NoDa and Cordelia Park, and northeast to the Uptown CycleLink at 7th Street. His primary running and biking infrastructure.</li>
          <li><strong>Veterans Park:</strong> Multi-use park with playground, splash pad, outdoor gym, disc golf, baseball diamonds, and tennis — a major family amenity immediately accessible from Commonwealth. Analogous to a neighborhood park with serious programming.</li>
          <li><strong>Evergreen Nature Preserve:</strong> 77-acre nature preserve with forest trails accessible from the neighborhood — offers more "nature" feel than typical Charlotte parks.</li>
          <li><strong>Midwood Park:</strong> 6-acre neighborhood park (slightly west, in Plaza Midwood) — playground, picnic shelter, amphitheater, neighborhood events.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> 10–15 minutes south by bike via the greenway; 98 acres with lake, spray pad, dog park, tennis.</li>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Flood risk</h3>
        <p>Little Sugar Creek runs through the area and some properties may be in FEMA flood zones. Address-level FEMA flood map lookup is essential before purchasing — particularly for homes near the creek corridor. Hurricane Helene (2024) demonstrated real flood risk throughout the Little Sugar Creek watershed.</p>
        <h3>Very limited inventory</h3>
        <p>Commonwealth is a small neighborhood with typically only 2–3 homes on the market at any given time. When the right house comes up, be ready to move within days — 23-day average DOM means you cannot deliberate. Having a local agent with neighborhood knowledge who can alert you immediately is essential.</p>
        <h3>School assignment</h3>
        <p>Same concern as Plaza Midwood — verify specific address at cmsk12.org before committing. Plan from day one to apply for Highland Mill Montessori or Chantilly Montessori via the CMS magnet lottery.</p>
        <h3>Development spillover</h3>
        <p>The massive Commonwealth mixed-use development (1710 Commonwealth Ave) will bring significant new density to the neighborhood's western edge. Construction activity and eventual new residents will change the feel of some nearby blocks. Residential streets deeper into Commonwealth should be more insulated.</p>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Strong.</strong> Commonwealth is essentially Plaza Midwood's quieter, more family-oriented residential sibling. If this family wants the Plaza Midwood lifestyle — walkable coffee, greenway access, character homes, proximity to Uptown — with a calmer residential environment and stronger family density, Commonwealth is worth serious attention. The 66 Walk Score reflects genuinely walkable access to Common Market and Undercurrent Coffee. Veterans Park is an excellent family amenity. The greenway connection means a 12–18 minute bike commute to Uptown.</p>
    <p>The primary downside is supply: Commonwealth is a small neighborhood where homes rarely list. The right house doesn't come up often, and when it does, 23-day average DOM means a quick decision is required. Watch this market closely and be ready to move. Flood risk on some blocks near Little Sugar Creek remains a concern requiring address-level verification.</p>
    <p>At $850k–$1.1M, this family can find a well-updated craftsman bungalow with 3–4 beds, genuine character, and a neighborhood that punches above its size. Strong contender alongside Plaza Midwood and Chantilly — the quieter, more family-dense choice within the same lifestyle corridor.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth is one of Charlotte's oldest neighborhoods, established in 1891, sitting about 1.5 miles southeast of Uptown. It has a distinctly urban feel — walkable streets, tree-lined avenues, a mix of bungalows, Colonial Revivals, Tudor cottages, and Craftsman homes on lots lined with magnolias, maples, and oaks. The 24-acre Independence Park anchors the neighborhood's center. Elizabeth Avenue is a modest commercial corridor with local restaurants and coffee.</p>
        <p>In 2024, Elizabeth was engaged in a significant internal debate about whether to pursue historic district designation — reflecting real tensions between preservation advocates and those who see preservation rules as increasing barriers. Axios Charlotte reported on a proposed multi-family development on 7th Street that City Council deferred. The neighborhood is actively wrestling with development pressure.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>The family density flag:</strong> Elizabeth has the lowest concentration of households with children of any neighborhood on this list, well below Charlotte's citywide average. The neighborhood is dominated by young renters and urban professionals without kids. One-third of single-family homes in Elizabeth are rentals, creating high turnover and lower community stability.
        </div>
        <p>Niche gives Elizabeth an A+ overall, ranked #10 best neighborhood in Charlotte. But it's primarily celebrated for young professionals, urban lifestyle, and proximity to amenities — not as a family neighborhood. For this family, the aesthetics and commute are appealing, but the community-with-kids priority is the hardest to find here of any neighborhood researched.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth has some of Charlotte's most architecturally interesting residential stock: "Clement and Greenway Avenues represent the neighborhood's character, with classic bungalows donning low-pitched roofs sitting alongside symmetrical Colonial Revivals, towering Tudors, and meticulous Craftsman homes" (Charlotte Magazine). Many have fenced yards and wide streets. Single-family homes range from ~$520,000 to $2.4M (average ~$1.02M).</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$800k:</strong> Smaller renovated bungalows (2–3 bed, 1,200–1,800 sq ft) or homes needing renovation. True 4-bed/2,500 sq ft in this range is difficult.</li>
          <li><strong>$800k–$950k:</strong> Updated 3–4 bedroom historic homes, 1,800–2,500 sq ft. This is where the best character homes live.</li>
          <li><strong>$950k–$1.1M:</strong> Fully renovated larger homes or high-quality new infills.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026, 28204):</strong> 99 SFH sales in the zip (shared with Chantilly/Colonial Village), median $1.0M, 48 sales (48%) in your $700k–$1.1M range. Price per sq ft: ~$391. Note that one-third of single-family homes here are rentals — affecting both supply and community stability.
        </div>
        <p>The housing character is genuinely appealing for what this family wants in a home. The neighborhood density question is the concern, not the houses themselves.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 66 — Somewhat Walkable. Elizabeth ranks 9th most walkable neighborhood in Charlotte. The 7th Street corridor and Elizabeth Avenue provide genuine walkable retail. LYNX Gold Line light rail runs through the neighborhood (7th Street station), improving transit access.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Benny's Coffee House (1499 Elizabeth Ave; opened Sept 2025 — lattes, croissants, lunch), The People's Market (1609 Elizabeth Ave; all-day cafe), Not Just Coffee (224 E. 7th St at 7th Street Public Market), Enderly Coffee (2001 E. 7th St — full bakery, breakfast sandwiches)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Harris Teeter accessible (1–2 mile drive/bike from most addresses), 7th Street Public Market (local vendors and prepared foods)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Elizabeth Avenue has local restaurants and bars. 7th Street corridor nearby. Good walkable dining options for the area.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>Elizabeth's coffee options are genuinely walkable from most addresses — this is a real strength. The LYNX Gold Line also gives car-free Uptown access.</span></div>

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Elizabeth is considered safe by Charlotte standards, consistent with other close-in urban neighborhoods. The neighborhood is adjacent to the 7th Street commercial/entertainment corridor, which brings some elevated property crime (car break-ins near restaurants and bars). Violent crime is low.</p>
        <p>Residents consistently describe Elizabeth as safe to walk at night. The elevated property crime numbers are typical for walkable urban neighborhoods with active commercial zones — a pattern common to close-in historic neighborhoods across most American cities.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Independence Park:</strong> 24 acres at the center of Elizabeth — good neighborhood park with open space, walking paths, and a community gathering point. Walking distance from most addresses.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible from Elizabeth via the Metropolitan Ave trailhead (~1 mile from Elizabeth's center). Connects to the 19.5-mile paved trail system.</li>
          <li><strong>Latta Park (Dilworth):</strong> Approximately 1 mile — bikeable.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> ~2–3 miles — a short bike ride.</li>

        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Family density — the core concern</h3>
        <p>Elizabeth has the lowest proportion of households with children of any neighborhood researched — a reality that is functionally hard to overcome for a family whose #1 priority is neighbors with young kids. The Elizabeth Community Association runs family events (egg hunts, holiday activities), but the pool of neighbors with same-age children is small. This is not a neighborhood where you'll find an organic community of parents with 4-year-olds on the block.</p>
        <h3>Development pressure</h3>
        <p>Elizabeth is actively wrestling with its future. The 2024 historic district debate, the proposed 7th Street multi-family rezoning (deferred by City Council), and ongoing pressure from developers mean the neighborhood character may shift meaningfully over the next 5–10 years. Buyers should be selective about which block they purchase on.</p>
        <h3>High renter rate</h3>
        <p>One-third of single-family homes in Elizabeth are rentals — creating more transience and turnover than a neighborhood like Chantilly or Myers Park. This reduces the community stability that matters most for a family prioritizing long-term neighbors with kids.</p>
        <h3>Airport noise</h3>
        <p>Elizabeth's location east of Uptown puts it outside the most likely impact zone of the proposed CLT flight path changes. Lower concern than Myers Park.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Weak–Moderate.</strong> Elizabeth has real appeal for this family on paper — historic homes with genuine character, Charlotte's best-in-class bike commute to Uptown (~8–15 min), walkable coffee and dining, and Eastover Elementary is excellent if your address is zoned there. The aesthetics are right. But the data consistently points away from Elizabeth as a family neighborhood.</p>
    <p>Only 8% of households have children (the lowest of any neighborhood researched), a third of single-family homes are rentals creating high turnover, and development pressure threatens the character that makes it attractive. This family's #1 priority — an organic community of neighbors with young kids — is the hardest to find here. Elizabeth works well for a couple without children or with older kids; it is not ideal for a family wanting to find their people on the block. Consider it only if a specific compelling property appears and you're prepared to build your social network intentionally rather than finding it next door.</p>

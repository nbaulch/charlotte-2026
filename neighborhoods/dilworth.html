        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Dilworth is Charlotte's first streetcar suburb, established in the 1890s, and widely considered the city's most iconic close-in residential neighborhood. It has a relaxed, slightly bohemian energy: tree-lined streets, Craftsman bungalows and Colonial Revival homes, front porches, and a walkable main commercial strip on East Boulevard. The vibe is "urban village" — young professionals, some established families, and long-timers who've stayed for decades.</p>
        <p>Politically it skews center-left. Niche ranks it <strong>#1 Best Neighborhood to Live in Charlotte</strong> overall (A+ grade). Residents praise the walkability, mature trees, Freedom Park access, and community feel — but some note it increasingly attracts young singles more than families, and South End's growth adds noise and traffic at the southern edge.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Family density caveat:</strong> The community skews young professional. Families do exist here (active PTA, Freedom Park gatherings), but you'll likely need to work harder to find your tribe than in Chantilly or Myers Park.

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Dilworth's housing stock is genuinely distinctive: 1910s–1940s Craftsman bungalows, Colonial Revivals, brick cottages, and some larger homes on east/west avenues. Teardown/new construction is active but generally respects the streetscape aesthetic.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$800k:</strong> Smaller renovated bungalows (2–3bd, 1,200–1,800 sqft) or larger homes needing updates. A true 4bd/2,500 sqft is possible but increasingly competitive.</li>
          <li><strong>$800k–$950k:</strong> Sweet spot. Updated 3–4bd homes, ~1,800–2,500 sqft, historic renovations, original hardwoods, mature landscaping. This is where character homes live.</li>
          <li><strong>$950k–$1.1M:</strong> Custom new-construction infills or fully renovated larger homes (2,500–3,500 sqft), 4+ beds, high-end finishes.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026):</strong> 318 Charlotte SFH sales in 28203 zip. Median: $926k. 97 sales (31%) in your $700k–$1.1M budget. Price/sqft: ~$440–$446. Lot sizes typically 0.10–0.30 acres — smaller than Minneapolis lots.
        </div>
        <p><strong>Standout pockets:</strong> Latta Park vicinity is the most family-friendly sub-pocket. Dilworth Historic District median is ~$910k. Mount Vernon Ave has Charlotte skyline views.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 78 — "Very Walkable." One of Charlotte's best. East Boulevard provides genuine walkable retail.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Dilworth Coffee (local roaster, 1989), Not Just Coffee (East Blvd, specialty), Central Coffee (719 Louise Ave — neighborhood anchor), Sunflour Baking (East Blvd, scratch pastries), Backyard Brew (Turkish coffee, in-house roast)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Harris Teeter at East Blvd (in-neighborhood) + Harris Teeter at South End (~0.5 mi). Trader Joe's at Metropolitan (~1.5 mi, bikeable on greenway)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>300 East (contemporary American, patio), Bakersfield (tacos/margaritas), Dilworth Neighbourhood Grille (kid-friendly bar &amp; grill), The Mayobird (casual deli)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>East Blvd is a genuine walkable commercial corridor — coffee, dining, groceries all within walking distance for most addresses. One of few Charlotte neighborhoods where you can do daily errands on foot.</span></div>

          <strong>Major boundary change — Fall 2026:</strong> Dilworth Elementary is being reorganized. A brand-new <strong>Park Road Elementary</strong> opens Fall 2026 and will serve kids currently zoned to Dilworth. The original Dilworth building becomes a magnet middle school. Verify your specific address assignment before buying.

        <p style="margin-top:12px;font-size:0.9rem;">The prior Dilworth Elementary (8/10 GreatSchools, top 10% NC) was excellent and community-oriented. The new Park Road school starts with no track record — it could be great or take time to stabilize. Many Dilworth families will be watching this closely in 2026–27.</p>
        <p><strong>Also nearby:</strong> Sedgefield Montessori (CMS magnet, top 6% NC) is an option via lottery. See <a href="../schools/index.html">Schools overview</a> for magnet lottery details.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p><strong>CrimeGrade assessment:</strong> Dilworth has elevated <em>property</em> crime (~1 in 14 chance of property crime victimization — above national norms). This primarily reflects car break-ins near restaurants, parks, and commercial corridors. <em>Violent</em> crime is genuinely low (~1 in 123 chance — well below national average).</p>
        <p>In practice: residents consistently describe the neighborhood as safe to walk at night. The elevated crime numbers are heavily driven by commercial zone statistics. This is comparable to walkable urban Minneapolis neighborhoods like Uptown or Lowry Hill.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park (98 acres):</strong> Immediately adjacent to Dilworth's southern edge. 7-acre lake, 2 playgrounds, <strong>spray pad</strong>, dog park, tennis, baseball, kayaking, concession stand. Discovery Place Nature museum (undergoing renovation). Charlotte's premier family park — think Minneapolis's Lake Harriet, but driveable to on foot.</li>
          <li><strong>Latta Park (31 acres):</strong> In-neighborhood park with spray pad, playgrounds, tennis, basketball, open fields. The Tuesday-afternoon walkable park.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> 19.5 miles, paved, accessed from multiple Dilworth points. Runs north toward NoDa, south toward SC state line. The primary running and bike commute infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For running: the greenway from Dilworth heading south to Park Road Park and beyond gives miles of flat, paved trail. The "Booty Loop" (Queens Road West) is a beloved hilly 6–10 mile cycling/running route in adjacent Myers Park.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Flood risk</h3>
        <p>Little Sugar Creek runs adjacent to Dilworth and has flooded during heavy events (Jan 2023, Hurricane Helene 2024). Risk is not neighborhood-wide — specific blocks near the creek corridor (east of South Blvd) should be individually verified via FEMA Flood Map Service Center before purchase.</p>
        <h3>Airport noise</h3>
        <p>Dilworth is not in a current major CLT flight path. The proposed 2024 expansion of departure routes (approved by City Council, pending FAA) is more likely to affect neighborhoods directly north/south of the airport. Dilworth's central-east position gives some insulation.</p>
        <h3>Development pressure</h3>
        <p>South End (immediately north) is one of Charlotte's most actively developing corridors. The blend of South End density into Dilworth's southern edge is real — more traffic, more noise, some business turnover on East Blvd. The neighborhood civic association has managed growth well but South End's pace is relentless.</p>
        <h3>School transition</h3>
        <p>Fall 2026 brings a brand-new Park Road Elementary with no track record. The prior Dilworth Elementary community is being dispersed. This creates some risk for the first 1–2 years as the new school establishes itself.</p>

  <!-- BOTTOM LINE -->
  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate–Strong.</strong> Dilworth is, on paper, the most exciting neighborhood on this list for everything except family density. The walkability is real (coffee, groceries, restaurants on foot), the bike commute to Uptown is among the best (~10–15 min, greenway-connected), Freedom Park is a world-class urban amenity at your doorstep, and the housing stock has exactly the character and design intentionality you're looking for. The budget fits well — 31% of recent sales in 28203 were in your range.</p>
    <p>The big flag: only 11–12% of households have children. This family's #1 priority — neighbors with young kids — is harder to find organically in Dilworth than in Chantilly, Myers Park, or even Sedgefield. You may find your family network through the PTA, Freedom Park, and organized activities rather than from the neighbors immediately around you. If you're comfortable actively cultivating that community, Dilworth is exceptional. If you need it to already exist next door, look at Chantilly first.</p>
    <p><strong>Also flag:</strong> The new Park Road Elementary (fall 2026) is an unknown quantity. Visit the neighborhood, talk to current Dilworth families about the transition, and verify your specific address's school assignment.</p>

      <h1>Villa Heights</h1>
      <p class="summary">A rapidly gentrifying former textile-mill neighborhood north of NoDa with Cordelia Park (24 acres, splash pad, pool) and Cross Charlotte Trail access at its center. Excellent Uptown proximity (~2.5 miles), strong greenway infrastructure — but the weakest school pipeline of any neighborhood in this study, very low family density (9% with kids), and elevated crime.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Villa Heights — "the village on the hill" — traces its roots to circa 1900, when developer Clayton O. Brown built it as a working-class textile mill suburb. Part of Charlotte's first entirely working-class suburban district (Belmont-Villa Heights-Optimist Park), it has undergone dramatic transformation in recent years: property prices up 47% since 2020, near-complete demographic shift from historically Black/working-class to young professionals.</p>
        <p>Today the population (~1,932) is roughly 48% Black, 45% White, 15% Hispanic. Median age 34.4, median household income $82k. The <strong>Villa Heights Community Organization</strong> hosts yearly events including summer kick-off parties, Easter egg hunts, and meetups at Cordelia Park and Free Range Brewing.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Critical family concern:</strong> Only <strong>9% of adults have children</strong> — the lowest family density of any neighborhood researched. The family's #1 priority is neighbors with young kids. Villa Heights is currently dominated by young professionals and couples without kids. The "Lynnhurst feel" with block parties and kids running between yards is not the current character here. UC Berkeley's Urban Displacement Project also flags Villa Heights for "ongoing low-income displacement."

        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Mix of <strong>original mill cottages/bungalows</strong> (early 1900s, often 800–1,200 sqft) and <strong>new construction infill</strong> (2018–present, typically 2,000–2,500 sqft, modern/contemporary design). Active builders include Vista Homes, Alenky Signature Homes, and Keen Building Company. Lots are generally small (typical urban infill).</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$500k–$650k:</strong> Original bungalow, renovated, 2–3bd — likely too small for 4bd needs</li>
          <li><strong>$650k–$835k:</strong> New construction single-family, 3–4bd, ~2,000–2,500 sqft, modern design. This is the target range.</li>
          <li><strong>$835k–$1.1M:</strong> Premium new construction — your budget buys the top of this market</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Design caution:</strong> Many new builds are contemporary/modern boxes on narrow lots — functional and well-built, but potentially the "cookie-cutter new construction" the family specifically wants to avoid. The original bungalows have character but are typically too small for a 4bd need.
        </div>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (28206 zip):</strong> 94 SFH sales, median $430k zip-wide. Villa Heights new construction commands $650k+, well above the zip median. 15 sales (16%) fell in your $700k–$1.1M range. Average 25–40 days on market.

        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Villa Heights Elementary</strong> is small (130 students, 13:1 ratio) — parents describe it as a "hidden gem" with inclusive culture. But test scores are weak: 40% reading proficiency, 58% math. The middle and high school pipeline is the worst in this study: <strong>Garinger High at 1/10 with a 57% graduation rate</strong>.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Weakest school pipeline in the study.</strong> All three assigned schools score C+ or below. Garinger High's 57% graduation rate is a non-starter for a family coming from the Kenny/Anthony/Southwest pipeline. Magnet, charter, or private school from day one is essential — not optional.

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>AreaVibes rates crime at <strong>F</strong> — total crime 236% above national average. Property crime risk: 1 in 18. Violent crime risk: 1 in 70. The year-over-year trend is <strong>-3% (declining)</strong>, consistent with gentrification-driven improvement.</p>
        <p>Livability score: 73/100 overall — strong grades for amenities (B-), commute (A+), cost of living (A+), housing (A+), but the crime F is a drag. Safer than 31% of NC cities.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cordelia Park — 24 acres:</strong> The neighborhood's flagship asset. Splash pad/sprayground, swimming pool, new playground, basketball court (recently renovated with artistic lighting), community garden (11 plots, established 2014), events pavilion. Charlotte skyline views from the hilltop.</li>
          <li><strong>Cross Charlotte Trail (XCLT):</strong> The 26-mile greenway runs directly through Cordelia Park. Connects south to Uptown via Little Sugar Creek Greenway and north toward UNC Charlotte. This is best-in-class greenway access.</li>
          <li><strong>Progress Park:</strong> 0.5-acre neighborhood pocket park with renovated playground.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible via the XCLT connection — Charlotte's premier 19.5-mile trail system.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>For a runner/cyclist:</strong> The Cross Charlotte Trail through Cordelia Park is one of the strongest greenway assets of any neighborhood in this study. Direct off-road access to both Uptown and extended trail networks. Cordelia Park's splash pad and pool are excellent family amenities for Charlotte summers.

        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Very low family density</h3>
        <p>At 9% of adults with children, this is overwhelmingly a young-professional neighborhood. The Easter egg hunts and community events exist but are small-scale. You would not be stepping into an established family-with-kids community — you'd be one of the first wave.</p>
        <h3>Active gentrification</h3>
        <p>Property prices up 47% since 2020. UC Berkeley flags this neighborhood for ongoing low-income displacement. The demographic transformation is nearly complete. The family would be part of this wave — worth considering the social dynamics.</p>
        <h3>Rail noise</h3>
        <p>Norfolk Southern rail line runs nearby — potential noise concern for some addresses. Check proximity before committing to a specific property.</p>
        <h3>New construction design</h3>
        <p>Most homes in the target price range are modern infill construction — contemporary boxes on narrow lots. If "character and personality" in housing is important, the architectural options here are limited compared to Chantilly, Plaza Midwood, or Dilworth.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Weak–Moderate.</strong> Villa Heights has genuine strengths: the Cross Charlotte Trail through Cordelia Park provides best-in-class greenway access, the Uptown bike commute (~2.5 mi) is excellent, the budget fits comfortably, and the VHCO provides real community infrastructure. The Walk Score (63) and Transit Score (50) are solid for Charlotte.</p>
    <p>But it significantly mismatches the family's core priorities: (1) only 9% of adults have children — the "neighbors with young kids" dynamic doesn't exist; (2) the school pipeline is the weakest in the study (all C+ or below, Garinger High at 1/10); (3) crime is elevated (AreaVibes F); (4) the housing stock is primarily new-construction modern boxes that may not deliver the "character" they seek. Villa Heights is a great neighborhood for a young professional couple — it's a challenging fit for a family prioritizing stable community, strong schools, and architectural character.</p>

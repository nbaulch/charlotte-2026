      <h1>Wesley Heights</h1>
      <p class="summary">Charlotte's most surprising neighborhood. Historic 1911 craftsman district, the best greenway bike commute in the city (Stewart Creek Greenway directly to Uptown), and home to Sauna House — Charlotte's communal bathhouse and the closest analog to Minneapolis sauna culture. Serious caveats: assigned elementary school is weak (Bruns Ave 2/10), crime statistics are elevated, and 4-bed homes are scarce.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Wesley Heights is one of Charlotte's eight designated historic districts — founded in 1911 as the first historic neighborhood on Charlotte's Westside, added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. The streets are canopied by mature trees; the homes are craftsman bungalows and arts-and-crafts cottages from the early 20th century, with consistent architectural character and genuine design intentionality. It is less than a mile from the heart of Uptown, yet has maintained a peaceful, largely residential feel.</p>
        <p>Wesley Heights has experienced significant revitalization in recent years, with new restaurants, coffee shops, and businesses arriving while the historic residential fabric is protected by the historic district designation. Station West (a mixed-use development) brought The Batch Maker, Backdrop Coffee, and event space. The neighborhood is described as a "vibrant community that thrives on connection, care, and collaboration." Politics skew progressive.</p>
        <p>The defining third-place amenity: <strong>Sauna House</strong> — Charlotte's premier communal sauna/cold plunge bathhouse — opened its flagship Charlotte location in Wesley Heights, at W. Morehead St. Built in a restored 1934 building with exposed brick and bow-truss ceilings, it features two massive saunas and cold plunges accommodating 30–50 people, plus private bathhouses. This is a direct analog to the Minneapolis sauna culture the family values. $50 drop-in.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Home size constraint:</strong> Wesley Heights is a small neighborhood (~1,200–1,500 residents) and housing stock is predominantly 2–3 bedroom bungalows. Finding a 4-bedroom, 2,500 sqft home here is difficult — this is the primary constraint on this neighborhood as a recommendation.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Almost exclusively 1910s–1940s craftsman bungalows and arts-and-crafts style homes. The historic district designation protects exterior character. These are exactly the "design intentionality" homes this family values — not cookie-cutter.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Median sale price:</strong> ~$680k (recent months, up 36% YoY — rapidly appreciating)</li>
          <li><strong>Sample listings:</strong> 3 bed/2 bath/1,804 sqft at $750k; 3 bed/3.5 bath/1,857 sqft at $699k; renovated homes selling $800k+</li>
          <li><strong>4-bedroom homes are rare</strong> — most Wesley Heights homes are 2–3 bed, 1,500–2,000 sqft. A 4-bed at 2,500 sqft may not exist in original stock.</li>
          <li><strong>$700k–$900k</strong> is the realistic price band; upper budget ($1M+) buys the best available</li>
          <li>Homes spending ~133 days on market — longer than comparable neighborhoods (small neighborhood effect / pricing sensitivity)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Can this family find a 4-bed in Wesley Heights?</strong> Possibly, but with difficulty. They may need to accept 3-bed or look at a home that has been thoughtfully expanded. This is the single biggest constraint on Wesley Heights as a recommendation.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 49 — car-dependent for groceries. But Bike Score 72 is the highest in this study, reflecting the Stewart Creek Greenway's direct Uptown connection. The local amenity set is growing: Not Just Coffee, Backdrop Coffee, Sauna House, Pinky's Westside Grill, Open Kitchen, Rhino Market.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Not Just Coffee (Jay St — Charlotte specialty coffee institution), Backdrop Coffee (at Station West)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>No walkable option — drive to nearby Harris Teeter or Publix (5–8 min). A gap for daily life.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Pinky's Westside Grill (quirky American diner, neighborhood institution), Open Kitchen (Italian), Rhino Market (deli + local beer), Station West food vendors, various breweries</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Wellness / Third Place:</span><span>Sauna House (W. Morehead St — communal bathhouse, $50 drop-in, direct Minneapolis sauna analog — arguably the best "third place" amenity of any neighborhood in this study)</span></div>

        <h2><span class="icon">🎓</span> Schools</h2>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Bruns Avenue Elementary is assigned to Wesley Heights. GreatSchools: 2/10. 17% math proficiency, 12% reading proficiency — significantly below district and state averages.</strong> This is a serious concern. Families buying in Wesley Heights must have either: (a) a firm plan to apply for a magnet school via CMS lottery, or (b) budget for private school (~$17k–$25k/child/year). Do not buy in Wesley Heights without a concrete school strategy.

        <h2><span class="icon">🚲</span> Commute</h2>
        <h3>His commute to Uptown (100 N Tryon St)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bike:</strong> ~1.5–2.5 miles via Stewart Creek Greenway → Uptown CycleLink. The Skyline Trail is 2.3 miles, approximately <strong>14 minutes</strong> by bike. This may be the best greenway bike commute to Uptown of any neighborhood researched — the Stewart Creek Greenway goes directly to downtown with minimal road riding.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> ~5 minutes — essentially adjacent to Uptown.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Her commute to Wake Forest / Winston-Salem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> ~75–90 min. Wesley Heights is well-positioned for westbound I-85 access — actually slightly better than Plaza Midwood/Commonwealth given proximity to I-77 and I-277. One of the faster Winston-Salem commutes among neighborhoods researched.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>AreaVibes crime rating: <strong>F</strong> — estimated 485% above the national average; violent crime 119% above; property crime 559% above. <strong>This is a significant data point that requires contextualization.</strong></p>
        <p>Wesley Heights borders areas with significantly higher crime (to the south and west), and AreaVibes extrapolations at small neighborhood scale can be distorted by proximity to higher-crime bordering areas. The physical neighborhood itself — the historic bungalow blocks — is described by residents as feeling safe and walkable. Property crime (vehicle theft, package theft) is the primary concern, not violent crime.</p>
        <p>Sauna House's opening here, and the wave of new restaurants and businesses, signals investor confidence in the neighborhood's trajectory.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Families should visit and talk to residents</strong> — the statistical picture is concerning but may not match the lived experience on the historic residential blocks specifically. Do not rely on aggregated zip-level stats alone.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Stewart Creek Greenway:</strong> The defining outdoor asset. Runs ~1.5 miles from the neighborhood directly to Uptown, with a 2.8-mile out-and-back trail option. Connects to Irwin Creek Greenway for extended running/biking.</li>
          <li><strong>Wesley Heights Greenway:</strong> 3-mile nature preserve and creekside path extending through multiple neighborhoods.</li>
          <li><strong>Irwin Creek Greenway:</strong> 3.2 miles connecting to the broader Charlotte greenway system.</li>
          <li><strong>Bank of America Stadium:</strong> Adjacent — game days bring crowds, but also urban energy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For running: the Stewart Creek and Irwin Creek combination provides meaningful off-road mileage directly from the neighborhood. The greenway access here is genuinely exceptional for an in-town neighborhood.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>School assignment</h3>
        <p>Bruns Avenue Elementary (2/10) is the biggest practical barrier to buying in Wesley Heights. Resolve the school question first before falling in love with a house here. Apply for CMS magnet lottery in fall 2026 for fall 2027 Kindergarten.</p>
        <h3>Crime statistics</h3>
        <p>AreaVibes gives an F rating. Requires a ground-truth site visit at different times of day and resident conversations. Don't dismiss it, but don't take it as the final word either. The specific historic bungalow blocks are reported to feel considerably safer than the aggregate statistics suggest.</p>
        <h3>Grocery access</h3>
        <p>No walkable grocery — a daily friction point for a family with young twins. Plan for a short drive to Harris Teeter or Publix for routine shopping.</p>
        <h3>Home size constraint</h3>
        <p>4-bed at 2,500 sqft is genuinely hard to find. May need to accept 3-bed or a home that can be expanded. This requires realistic expectation-setting before falling in love with the neighborhood's character.</p>
        <h3>Flood risk</h3>
        <p>Stewart Creek flooding is a real concern for some creek-adjacent properties. Address-level FEMA flood map check is essential before purchase — do not skip this step.</p>
      </div>

  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate–Strong (with significant caveats).</strong> Wesley Heights is genuinely compelling for this family in ways that are hard to find elsewhere: the greenway bike commute to Uptown is the best of any neighborhood researched, Sauna House is the closest analog to their Minneapolis third-place lifestyle, the historic bungalow character is exactly what they want architecturally, and the neighborhood has a real community ethos.</p>
    <p>However, the caveats are serious: (1) Bruns Avenue Elementary (2/10) requires a firm private school or magnet strategy before buying here; (2) crime statistics are elevated — a ground-truth visit is essential; (3) 4-bedroom homes at 2,500 sqft are scarce; (4) no walkable grocery. Wesley Heights should absolutely be visited. If the family can find a right-sized home, is comfortable with the school situation, and the street-level reality matches what they want — this could be their neighborhood. The Sauna House factor is a genuine differentiator not found anywhere else in this study.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Eastover is Charlotte's most prestigious in-town neighborhood — developed in the 1920s and 1930s as an enclave for Charlotte's business and professional elite, and maintained that status for a century. Wide, curving, heavily canopied streets. Grand estate homes on lots of 0.5–2 acres. The neighborhood exudes quiet, secure, established wealth — "old Charlotte money" with some newer affluence.</p>
        <p>Eastover leans conservative politically. It is family-friendly in the sense of being very safe, well-schooled, and established, but not particularly "young family" in demographic composition. The vibe is serene and exclusive rather than community-event oriented. Nextdoor reviews cite "beautiful, charming, clean, dog friendly, family friendly, peaceful, safe, walkability." 83% owner-occupied homes.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Calibration value:</strong> Understanding Eastover helps this family appreciate that spending $950k in Plaza Midwood or Myers Park buys a genuinely good life in Charlotte — not a compromise. Eastover is what $2.5M+ looks like.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Grand historic homes from the 1920s–1940s mixed with large newer construction. Lot sizes of 0.5–2 acres are common — Charlotte's finest residential properties by any measure.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Budget reality:</strong> Median sale price ~$2.275M (2025), up 33% YoY. Active listings: multiple properties $2M–$5M+. Price range: $230k (outlier/condo) to $6.975M+. What $1.1M gets in Eastover: almost certainly something at the absolute entry level — a small home, a condo, or a property requiring significant work. A conventional single-family home that meets this family's criteria (4-bed, 2,500 sqft, character, backyard) starts at $1.5M–$2M+. Eastover is effectively out of reach.
        </div>
        <p>If the family finds itself drawn to Eastover's physical characteristics — large lot, estate-scale home — the better comparisons are Myers Park's upper end or considering what $1.1M buys in select suburban areas.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 51, Bike Score 39 — the lowest bike score among all neighborhoods studied. Despite being close to Uptown (~1.5 miles), Eastover scores relatively low on walkability because it is purely residential with no commercial walkability. Residents drive to restaurants, groceries, and amenities.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>None walkable within Eastover. Residents drive to Myers Park's Providence Road corridor, SouthPark, or Uptown.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Harris Teeter and Publix accessible by short drive. No walkable grocery within the neighborhood.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Myers Park's Providence Rd corridor has upscale dining options by car. South Park and Uptown are short drives.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>The low bike score (39, lowest in study) reflects large lots and winding residential streets not designed for active transportation. This is not a neighborhood for daily cycling errands.</span></div>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;">Eastover Elementary: 67% math proficiency, 67% reading proficiency — decent but not exceptional. Top 20% in Charlotte. Many Eastover families send children to private schools (Charlotte Latin, Providence Day) regardless, given the neighborhood's income profile.</p>
        <p>The eventual high school pipeline (Myers Park High, Niche A) is excellent and shared with Chantilly, Dilworth, Sedgefield, and other in-budget neighborhoods.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🚲</span> Commute</h2>
        <h3>His commute to Uptown (100 N Tryon St)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Bike:</strong> ~2–3 miles; doable but Bike Score 39 reflects limited infrastructure — more on-road than greenway. Not the bike-commuter's ideal despite proximity.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> ~5–8 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Her commute to Wake Forest / Winston-Salem</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Drive:</strong> ~85–100 min. Eastover's Myers Park-adjacent location means slightly longer I-85 access compared to west-side neighborhoods. The route requires traversing Uptown or using I-277 to reach I-85 N.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Eastover is one of Charlotte's safest neighborhoods — expected given the demographic profile and private lot design. Effectively no crime concerns of substance reported by residents or in aggregate data.</p>
        <p>The combination of low traffic (private estate road network), high homeownership (83%), and established long-term residents creates a naturally low-crime environment. This is a genuine strength, especially for families with young children, and contrasts sharply with close-in urban neighborhoods like Wesley Heights or NoDa.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible via adjacent Myers Park — the greenway runs through Freedom Park. Not directly within Eastover but reachable by short bike ride.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> Approximately 1 mile from Eastover — walking or biking access feasible. 98 acres with full amenity set.</li>
          <li><strong>Private lots:</strong> Large private lots serve as the primary outdoor space — Eastover homes have the yard space this family dreams of. 0.5–2 acre lots are common.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The greenway and park infrastructure is good but comparable to what in-budget neighborhoods like Dilworth and Myers Park offer — Eastover's distinction is its private lot scale, not superior public park access.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Budget gap</h3>
        <p>The family's $700k–$1.1M range is $1M+ below the Eastover median. This is not a stretch — it's a different market entirely. Do not spend emotional energy on Eastover as a buying prospect.</p>
        <h3>Conservative culture</h3>
        <p>Eastover skews older, established, and politically conservative. Young transplant professionals would be a minority demographic. The liberal-leaning, upper-middle-class culture the family experienced in Lynnhurst is not the predominant tone here.</p>
        <h3>Private lot living</h3>
        <p>The large-lot design means less street-level community interaction than Chantilly or Plaza Midwood. Neighbors might not be regularly seen unless actively sought out — the opposite of the "neighbors with young kids next door" dynamic this family prioritizes.</p>
        <h3>No walkable amenities</h3>
        <p>Unlike Dilworth or Elizabeth, there is nothing walkable in Eastover. No coffee shop within a mile's walk — a mismatch with the family's stated preference regardless of budget.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Reference Only — Out of Budget.</strong> Eastover is beautiful, safe, and prestigious — and essentially inaccessible at this family's budget. It is included here as a calibration point: Charlotte's truly elite in-town residential neighborhood requires $2M+. The family's $700k–$1.1M budget puts them squarely in the Plaza Midwood / Myers Park / Chantilly tier, which is a very good tier and will yield excellent quality of life in Charlotte.</p>
    <p>Do not spend emotional energy on Eastover as a buying prospect. What it illustrates is how well-positioned the family's budget is for neighborhoods like Chantilly, Dilworth, and Myers Park — neighborhoods that offer genuine walkability, young family community density, and good schools at accessible price points. Eastover's strengths (safety, lot size, prestige) come at a $1M+ premium that cannot be bridged within this budget.</p>

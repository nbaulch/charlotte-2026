        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Plaza Hills is one of Charlotte's earliest streetcar suburbs, adjacent to Plaza Midwood and sharing the 28205 zip code. Best understood as Plaza Midwood's quieter, more suburban residential sibling — historic homes from the 1940s–1980s on tree-lined streets, family-focused. The neighborhood has been popular for out-of-state movers in recent years, attracted by value relative to Plaza Midwood.</p>
        <p>Plaza Hills is small (~540 residents) and quiet — there is no commercial life within the neighborhood itself. The energy of Plaza Midwood's Central Avenue is close (5–10 minute walk) but the neighborhood is purely residential. Residents value the peace, more yard space, and the community garden at Midwood Park.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Mix of ranch-style homes, traditional brick homes, and updated mid-century properties from the 1960s–1980s, plus some 1940s-era homes on Plaza Midwood-adjacent blocks. Homes tend to have larger lots and more yard space than Plaza Midwood proper — a genuine positive for a family with young kids who want outdoor space.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Median home price:</strong> ~$710k–$826k (some data volatility due to small sample size)</li>
          <li><strong>$700k–$900k:</strong> 3–4 bed, 1,600–2,200 sqft, often on larger lots with real yard space</li>
          <li>Better value per sqft than Plaza Midwood for home size and yard relative to price</li>
          <li>Market: ~56 days on market; homes selling ~1% below list price (mild buyer's market)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (28205 zip):</strong> 928 SFH sales in 28205 (Plaza Midwood/Commonwealth/Plaza Hills combined); median $637.5k, 256 sales (28%) in budget. Plaza Hills specifically offers better yard space and slightly lower prices than Plaza Midwood proper — good if yard space is the priority.
        </div>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Home character varies widely:</strong> The 1960s–1980s ranch/brick homes range from "thoughtfully renovated mid-century gem" to "generic suburban." Do not assume all Plaza Hills homes have the "design intentionality" this family is looking for. Walk the specific block and assess the specific home carefully before committing.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 62 — reflects proximity to Plaza Midwood's commercial corridor. The 6-acre Midwood Park is within walking distance. No commercial walkability within Plaza Hills itself — all amenities are accessed via the short walk or bike to Plaza Midwood.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Summit Coffee, Undercurrent Coffee, Common Market, Plot Twist — all within walking distance in Plaza Midwood (5–10 min walk)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Earth Fare (short walk/drive), Publix accessible by car. Common Market (Plaza Midwood) serves as a neighborhood market hybrid.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Full access to Plaza Midwood's restaurant scene — Supperland, Calle Sol, Moo &amp; Brew, Common Market, and dozens of others within walking distance</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>The coffee-within-a-mile threshold is genuinely met — Plaza Midwood's commercial strip is a short walk from most Plaza Hills addresses. This is the neighborhood's primary walkability strength.</span></div>

          <strong>Magnet strategy:</strong> Apply for Highland Mill Montessori via the fall 2026 CMS magnet lottery for 2027–28 Kindergarten.

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Violent crime: estimated 1 in 878 — very low for Charlotte. Property crime more common (elevated compared to national average), typical for an urban/suburban interface adjacent to a busy commercial corridor.</p>
        <p>The 28205 zip code overall has crime above the national average, but Plaza Hills' residential interior is safer than the zip average suggests. A family with young kids would not have meaningful personal safety concerns day-to-day. The neighborhood's suburban residential character provides a natural buffer from the commercial corridor's higher property crime.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Midwood Park:</strong> 6-acre park with tennis, soccer, basketball, community garden, and playground — within walking distance. The neighborhood's primary outdoor gathering space.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible, running through the Plaza Midwood/Commonwealth corridor. Good running and biking infrastructure for daily use.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> 15–20 min by bike from Plaza Hills. 98 acres with full amenity set — tennis, volleyball, soccer, basketball, baseball, duck pond, spray pad.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The greenway and park access is comparable to Plaza Midwood — the same infrastructure serves both neighborhoods.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Home character varies widely</h3>
        <p>The mid-century ranch homes range from renovated gems with genuine character to nondescript suburban boxes. This family should be highly specific about which home they're buying — do not choose Plaza Hills in the abstract; choose a specific home and block that meets the character standard. The best Plaza Hills homes are thoughtfully renovated mid-century properties; the worst are exactly what this family wants to avoid.</p>
        <h3>Development spillover</h3>
        <p>Rising land values from Plaza Midwood's transformation are flowing into Plaza Hills. Some infill activity and renovation pressure. This is generally positive for values but can change the neighborhood's quiet residential feel at the margins.</p>
        <h3>School assignment</h3>
        <p>Must verify specific address assignment at cmsk12.org. Apply for Highland Mill Montessori magnet as the primary strategy. Do not assume — confirm before purchase.</p>
        <h3>Small neighborhood, limited listing volume</h3>
        <p>~540 residents means few listings at any given time. Be prepared to wait for the right home rather than settling on an available one that doesn't meet the character standard.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card" style="border-left:4px solid var(--teal);">
        <h2><span class="icon">📍</span> Nearby: Country Club Heights</h2>
        <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#666;">NPA 314 — adjacent area covered here.</p>
        <p>Country Club Heights sits east of Plaza-Shamrock and south of the Eastway Drive corridor. Characterized by <strong>1950s–1960s ranch homes</strong> on generous lots with mature tree canopy — similar mid-century character to Plaza Hills but at a lower price point (<strong>$478k median</strong>).</p>
        <p>The <strong>Country Club Heights Neighborhood Association</strong> is active with regular community events. The <strong>Briar Creek Greenway</strong> runs through the area, providing trail access for running and biking. Homes here have genuine yard space and the kind of "established residential" feel that the family values.</p>
        <p>For this family: Country Club Heights offers a budget-friendly alternative with character homes and community infrastructure. The school assignment is the same Shamrock Gardens → Eastway → Garinger pipeline (requiring a school choice plan). Walk Score is low (~30s), and the bike commute to Uptown is longer (~5 miles). Consider it if budget flexibility and yard space outweigh walkability — similar trade-offs to Plaza Hills but at a lower price point.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate.</strong> Plaza Hills is a reasonable choice for families seeking Plaza Midwood adjacency with more yard space and slightly better value per square foot. The neighborhood itself is quiet and residential without street life, but proximity to Plaza Midwood's amenities means walkable coffee and a thriving restaurant scene a short walk away. Safety is solid, school access via magnet lottery is feasible, and the greenway connects well.</p>
    <p>Not a top-tier recommendation — the mid-century ranch homes have less distinctive character than the craftsman bungalows in Plaza Midwood or Chantilly, and buyers need to be selective. Consider it as a strong backup to Plaza Midwood or Commonwealth if the right home surfaces at the right price — particularly if yard space is a higher priority than architectural character.</p>

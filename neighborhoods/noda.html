        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>NoDa (North Davidson) is Charlotte's designated arts district — murals, galleries, music venues, breweries, and indie restaurants clustered around 36th Street and North Davidson Street. The LYNX Blue Line light rail runs through NoDa, connecting it to Uptown and South End. It's a genuinely interesting and energetic neighborhood for what it is.</p>
        <p>What it is: a young singles and arts neighborhood. <strong>Median age: 33.3.</strong> Approximately 54% of residents are single and never-married. <strong>71% of households are non-family households.</strong> This isn't editorializing — these are the demographics.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Wrong demographic fit:</strong> This family's top priority is neighbors with young kids. NoDa has among the lowest concentrations of families with children of any neighborhood on this list. Finding neighbors with 4-year-old twins is not the NoDa experience — it's genuinely rare. This single factor is the primary reason NoDa is a Skip.
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>NoDa is primarily a rental and new construction market. Single-family home inventory is limited — the neighborhood is dominated by apartment complexes, townhomes, and mixed-use developments. What single-family stock exists tends to be modest bungalows rapidly being replaced by infill development. A 4-bed, 2,500 sqft home with a real backyard is genuinely difficult to find here.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$1.1M:</strong> Likely new construction townhomes (3 bed, 3.5 bath, ~1,800–2,000 sqft) or a rare renovated bungalow — attached product without meaningful backyard space is the typical result at this price point.</li>
          <li><strong>Character homes</strong> with yards at family-appropriate size are uncommon — the neighborhood skews toward attached and dense product.</li>
          <li><strong>Days on market: ~98 days</strong> (late 2025) — softer than comparable neighborhoods, signaling reduced demand for the product mix.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026, 28206):</strong> 94 SFH sales total, median $430k, only 15 sales (16%) in the $700k–$1.1M budget range. Very limited inventory of the type of home this family wants. The $700k+ budget puts them well above the NoDa median — they'd be overpaying relative to neighborhood norms for product that still doesn't fit their needs.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score ~60. The LYNX Blue Line provides genuine transit access to Uptown — a real asset for some households. The arts district commercial scene along 36th Street and North Davidson is walkable from many NoDa addresses.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Smelly Cat Coffeehouse &amp; Roastery (neighborhood institution, open patio, signature dark roast), Summit Coffee, Amelie's French Bakery (coffee + food, open 24/7 — a Charlotte institution with a devoted following)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Limited walkable grocery — a notable gap. Residents drive to nearby Publix or Harris Teeter. No in-neighborhood full-service grocery store.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Boudreaux's (Louisiana cajun/creole, neighborhood icon since 1999), Haberdish (Southern Living top-10, mill town cuisine), NoDa Brewing (taproom + food), Resident Culture (craft beer), plus the monthly 4th Friday Gallery Crawl and live music venues</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>NoDa's scene is excellent for adults going out. It is not especially family-oriented — no dedicated neighborhood playground comparable to Midwood Park or Latta Park.</span></div>

        <h2><span class="icon">🎓</span> Schools</h2>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Villa Heights Elementary: 2/10 GreatSchools</strong> — one of the weakest assigned schools on this list. Families in NoDa who care about elementary school quality must navigate the CMS magnet lottery or budget for private school, adding $15k–$25k+ per year per child. With twins, that's $30k–$50k+ annually in private school costs on top of a mortgage.

The full assigned pipeline (Villa Heights → Ranson → Garinger) is among the weaker trajectories on this list. Magnet lottery is the only realistic public school path for a family prioritizing academics.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>NoDa has elevated crime concerns relative to most neighborhoods on this list. CrimeGrade data indicates elevated crime relative to Charlotte averages. Business owners have publicly voiced concerns — incidents including shots fired on two separate occasions and a vandalism spree have been documented. Property crime index is significantly above the national average.</p>
        <p>Context: The neighborhood is generally well-lit during business hours and the arts district scene draws crowds. Some of Charlotte's higher-crime areas border NoDa to the north and east. For a family with young children, this requires weighing honestly.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Northern terminus at Cordelia Park — the 13.7+ mile paved corridor runs south through Plaza Midwood to Pineville via Freedom Park. NoDa sits at the top of this trail system, making southbound rides excellent.</li>
          <li><strong>Cordelia Park:</strong> Sprayground + pool, open space — directly adjacent to NoDa. The primary family park amenity for the neighborhood.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> ~4 miles south by greenway; 98 acres with lake, spray pad, dog park, tennis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Greenway access is genuinely good here. The trail infrastructure itself isn't a reason to rule out NoDa — it's most of what works.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Wrong demographic for this family's top priority</h3>
        <p>NoDa is a young singles and arts neighborhood. 71% of households are non-family households. The odds of finding neighbors with 4-year-old twins on your block are not in your favor. This is the defining reason NoDa doesn't fit.</p>
        <h3>Weak school assignment requires expensive alternatives</h3>
        <p>Villa Heights ES (2/10) is one of the weaker elementary schools in Charlotte. Without a successful magnet lottery placement, the only alternatives are private school ($15k–$25k+/year per child, so $30k–$50k+/year for twins) or an uncomfortably long charter commute. This is a significant ongoing cost added to an already high mortgage payment.</p>
        <h3>Arts district character eroding under development</h3>
        <p>NoDa is rapidly densifying with apartment complexes. The independent arts district character that makes it interesting is being diluted as rents rise and the original tenant mix is displaced. This is a legitimate concern for current NoDa residents, not a reason to rule it out for families — but worth noting.</p>
        <h3>LYNX Blue Line — asset for commuters, mixed for families</h3>
        <p>The light rail is excellent for Uptown commuting. It also brings transit-adjacent dynamics (higher foot traffic, denser development near stations) that affect neighborhood feel. Positive for commute; neutral-to-mixed for family street feel.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Skip.</strong> NoDa is genuinely cool and excellent for young singles or couples. It is not a good fit for this family. The top priority — neighbors with young kids — is rare here by the numbers (11% of households have children). The assigned elementary school (Villa Heights, 2/10) requires either a successful magnet lottery placement or private school costs that add $30k–$50k+/year for twins. The housing stock at this price point skews toward attached townhomes without meaningful backyard space. Crime statistics are elevated relative to most neighborhoods on this list.</p>
    <p>None of this is a knock on NoDa — it's an excellent neighborhood for a different type of resident. For this family, in their current life stage, it's the wrong fit across too many of the dimensions that matter most.</p>
    <p>Visit NoDa for dinner at Haberdish or drinks at NoDa Brewing; it's worth knowing. Don't buy here.</p>

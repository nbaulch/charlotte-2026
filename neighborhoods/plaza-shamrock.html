      <h1>Plaza-Shamrock</h1>
      <p class="summary">A humble, community-proud neighborhood east of Plaza Midwood with one of Charlotte's oldest active neighborhood associations (since 1950), distinctive shamrock street signs, and midcentury homes on generous lots. Walkable to Plaza Midwood's dining scene, more affordable than its flashier neighbors, and genuinely community-oriented — but elevated crime and a weak middle/high school pipeline require planning.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Plaza-Shamrock sits between Plaza Midwood, NoDa, and Country Club Heights — a quieter, more affordable pocket with its own strong identity. The <strong>Plaza-Shamrock Neighborhood Association</strong>, founded in 1950, is one of Charlotte's longest-running community organizations. Custom <strong>shamrock-shaped green street signs</strong> mark the boundaries and give the neighborhood a distinctive sense of place.</p>
        <p>Charlotte Magazine describes it as <em>"a humble working person's neighborhood perfectly nestled between all the flashier neighborhoods."</em> Wide, tree-shaded, winding streets are popular with pedestrians and cyclists. During COVID, neighbors helped each other with shopping and yard work; musician Josh Daniel livestreamed daily front-porch concerts. The neighborhood has resisted the "smash-and-rebuild" dynamic that transformed adjacent Plaza Midwood.</p>
        <p>Demographics: 44% Black, 39% White, 9% Hispanic — genuinely diverse. Niche gives it a <strong>Diversity Grade of A</strong> and an overall <strong>B</strong>. Historically working-class, increasingly attracting young families priced out of Plaza Midwood.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Community strength:</strong> The 75-year-old neighborhood association, the pandemic mutual-aid response, and the community garden at Shamrock Park signal real community infrastructure — the kind of organic neighbor culture this family is seeking. Shamrock's community feel may actually be stronger than some higher-rated neighborhoods because it's built on decades of continuity, not recent gentrification-era energy.

        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Primarily <strong>1940s–1960s midcentury ranch homes</strong> — small (1,000–1,500 sqft originals), atomic ranch, and some Cape Cod styles. Average home age is 64 years. Lots are generous for this close to Uptown (0.15–0.60 acres), with mature trees providing deep shade and genuine yard space.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$380k–$500k:</strong> Original unrenovated ranch, 2–3bd, ~1,200 sqft — likely too small</li>
          <li><strong>$500k–$700k:</strong> Renovated/expanded midcentury home with updates. Realistic entry point.</li>
          <li><strong>$700k–$900k:</strong> Well-renovated 3–4bd or newer construction. Your budget buys a top-of-market home here.</li>
          <li><strong>$900k–$1.1M:</strong> Premium properties on Country Club Dr or The Plaza corridor</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (28205 zip):</strong> 928 SFH sales, median $637k zip-wide. Plaza-Shamrock specifically: 24 sales since Jan 2024, median $582k. Your budget puts you well above the neighborhood median — strong purchasing power. Average 126 days on market (Rocket Homes) — less competitive than Chantilly or Dilworth.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 55 — Somewhat Walkable. Scores vary across the neighborhood: addresses near The Plaza (western edge, toward Plaza Midwood) score up to 81; deeper in the neighborhood, scores drop to the low 50s.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Giddy Goat Coffee Roasters on The Plaza (~0.5 mi from western edge), Undercurrent Coffee and Central Coffee in Plaza Midwood (walkable from some addresses)</span></div>

        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Mattie's Diner (1940s diner car, neighborhood icon), Letty's (Southern comfort), Crispy Banh Mi (Vietnamese). Plaza Midwood's full scene is a short walk/bike.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>The "coffee within a mile" bar is met from Shamrock's western edge via Plaza Midwood's strip. From deeper in the neighborhood, it's a bike ride. Light rail (LYNX Blue Line) accessible within ~1 mile at the 36th Street station.</span></div>

        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Shamrock Gardens Elementary</strong> is a Gifted & Talented magnet that underwent a $30 million rebuild in 2020–2022. New 45-classroom facility; 497 students; 57% math proficiency, 55% reading — above CMS averages. Diverse student body (46% White, 24% Black, 21% Hispanic). A bright spot.</p>
        <p>The middle and high school assignments are the same weakness as Plaza Midwood: Eastway Middle (4/10) and Garinger High (1/10, 57% graduation rate). Families here should plan for magnet/charter/private from middle school onward.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Same school concern as Plaza Midwood:</strong> The elementary is decent (newly rebuilt magnet), but the Garinger High pipeline (1/10 GreatSchools, 57% graduation rate) means you need a school choice strategy from the start. Apply for Hawthorne Academy, Charlotte Lab School, or plan private.

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>AreaVibes rates crime at <strong>F</strong> — total crime 428% above national average. CrimeGrade.org places it in the 5th percentile for safety (95% of neighborhoods are safer). The northwest part of the neighborhood is considered the safest area.</p>
        <p>Context matters: crime statistics for small neighborhoods can be skewed by adjacent commercial corridors and a few high-incident blocks. The crime profile is more comparable to NoDa or Commonwealth than to truly high-crime areas. The neighborhood has been gentrifying steadily, and ground-level safety in the residential core is likely better than the aggregate statistics suggest — but this is an honest concern relative to Dilworth, Chantilly, or Myers Park.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Shamrock Park:</strong> 2-acre neighborhood park — playground, pickleball court, tennis court, volleyball, picnic shelter, walking trail, community garden. Hosts neighborhood concerts and movie nights.</li>
          <li><strong>Briar Creek Greenway:</strong> 2.9-mile trail (4 segments, some gaps) runs near the neighborhood's edge. County is actively expanding it — the Central to Monroe segment is in progress.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible via a short bike ride west through Plaza Midwood — Charlotte's flagship 19.5-mile trail system.</li>
          <li><strong>Midwood Park:</strong> Adjacent Plaza Midwood's 6-acre community park with playground, amphitheater, and farmers market.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In-neighborhood park is small but functional for young kids. Running routes primarily use the wide, tree-shaded neighborhood streets or the nearby Little Sugar Creek Greenway via Plaza Midwood.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Crime is the main concern</h3>
        <p>The crime statistics are the highest of any "Worth Considering" neighborhood. While gentrification is improving safety year over year, the current numbers are elevated enough that block-level research matters. Visit at different times of day before committing.</p>
        <h3>Greenway gaps</h3>
        <p>Briar Creek Greenway is nearby but currently fragmented into 4 disconnected segments. The county is actively expanding it, but today it's not a seamless running/biking corridor like the Little Sugar Creek Greenway.</p>
        <h3>Gentrification in progress</h3>
        <p>Plaza-Shamrock is mid-transition — exciting and affordable, but some rougher edges remain. The neighborhood's character is shifting as young families and professionals move in. If you're comfortable with that transition state, the long-standing neighborhood association provides real community infrastructure.</p>
        <h3>Budget advantage</h3>
        <p>Your $700k–$1.1M budget buys a top-of-market home here. Unlike Chantilly or Dilworth where you're stretching, in Plaza-Shamrock you're choosing the best available. This gives you negotiating power and reduces financial stress.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate.</strong> Plaza-Shamrock delivers genuine community infrastructure (75-year neighborhood association, community garden, neighborhood events) and real character (midcentury homes on generous lots, mature trees, shamrock street signs). The budget goes further here than almost anywhere else on the target list, and proximity to Plaza Midwood's dining and coffee scene means walkable amenities are genuinely accessible from the western edge.</p>
    <p>The trade-offs are significant: crime statistics are the highest of any "Worth Considering" neighborhood (AreaVibes F), the school pipeline after elementary is weak (same Garinger High 1/10 concern as Plaza Midwood), and the neighborhood is mid-gentrification with some rougher edges. This is a value pick for a family comfortable with the transition state and committed to a school choice strategy — not a first-look neighborhood, but worth a drive-through if Chantilly, Plaza Midwood, or Commonwealth don't pan out on inventory.</p>

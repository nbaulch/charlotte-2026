      <h1>Cherry</h1>
      <p class="summary">One of Charlotte's oldest neighborhoods, founded in 1891 as the city's first community designed for Black homeownership. Today it's a rapidly gentrifying close-in neighborhood just south of Uptown with excellent walkability (Walk Score 80), strong transit access, and an unbeatable bike commute — but very low homeownership and elevated crime.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Cherry sits just south of Uptown Charlotte, one of the closest residential neighborhoods to the city core. Founded in 1891 by John and Mary Myers as the first community designed to provide homeownership for Black laborers and working-class families, it's named for the cherry trees that once covered the hillsides. Historic institutions include Morgan School (1925), Myers Chapel, and Pearl Street Park with its monument to Charlotte's African American community.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood has undergone dramatic demographic change: the Black population dropped from 66% (1990) to roughly 37% (2015), and by 2019 Cherry was 57% white. Today it's predominantly young professionals — median age 35.6, median household income $150k+. The vibe is urban, walkable, and liberal-leaning. Niche rates it <strong>A+ overall</strong> and ranks it #18 best neighborhood to live in Charlotte.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Homeownership concern:</strong> Only 31% of residents own their homes — the lowest of any neighborhood in this study. The family's #1 priority is stable neighbors with young kids who stay for years. Cherry's renter-heavy, young-professional demo makes building that community significantly harder. About 47% of residents have children under 18 (AreaVibes), which is surprisingly high, but the transience of a rental-heavy neighborhood works against the stable-neighbor dynamic.

        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Mix of original 1920s bungalows, late-1990s condo buildings, and modern infill single-family homes. The new construction tends toward California-style modern design — functional and attractive but potentially the "generic new construction" style the family wants to avoid.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$800k:</strong> Entry-level for single-family — renovated original bungalow or smaller new construction</li>
          <li><strong>$800k–$930k:</strong> New-build single-family, 3–4bd, modern design. Median range.</li>
          <li><strong>$930k–$1.1M:</strong> Premium new construction or well-appointed renovated home</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (28203 zip):</strong> Cherry shares the 28203 zip with Dilworth and Wilmore. The neighborhood-specific market is small — approximately 7 homes for sale at any given time, with 19 average days on market. Inventory is limited and moves fast.

        <p>Walk Score 80 — Very Walkable. This is the 4th most walkable neighborhood in Charlotte and one of Cherry's strongest attributes. Most daily errands can be accomplished on foot.</p>

          <strong>For your twins:</strong> This is a surprisingly strong school pipeline — significantly better than Plaza Midwood or Commonwealth's assigned schools. However, CMS boundary changes for 2026-27 may shift elementary assignments. Verify with a specific address before committing.

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>AreaVibes rates Cherry's crime at <strong>F</strong> — total crime rate 344% above the national average. However, the small population (~1,155) means a handful of incidents skew the per-capita statistics significantly. The year-over-year trend is down 3%, consistent with gentrification-driven crime reduction.</p>
        <p>The AreaVibes livability score is 72/100 overall, with A+ grades for amenities and commute, B for schools, but F for crime. This mirrors the pattern seen in other gentrifying close-in neighborhoods (NoDa, Villa Heights) — the statistics look worse than ground-level reality for a specific block, but the concern is real and property-level research matters.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Gentrification dynamics</h3>
        <p>Cherry is in the middle of a significant gentrification transformation. The family would be part of this wave — which carries social dynamics worth considering. Long-standing Black residents have expressed concerns about displacement. Charlotte Housing Authority is developing mixed-income housing (281 rental units) in the neighborhood.</p>
        <h3>Low homeownership</h3>
        <p>At 31% owner-occupied, Cherry has the lowest homeownership rate of any neighborhood in this study. This fundamentally undermines the "stable neighbors who stay for years" dynamic the family is seeking. Renters cycle more frequently, which affects the neighbor-community fabric.</p>
        <h3>Small inventory</h3>
        <p>Only ~7 homes for sale at any given time. The single-family market is very thin — expect to compete aggressively when something surfaces. The 19-day average DOM means you cannot deliberate.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate.</strong> Cherry offers the best Walk Score (80) and one of the shortest bike commutes (~1.5 mi to Uptown) of any neighborhood in this study. The school pipeline is surprisingly strong (Elizabeth Traditional → Piedmont IB → Myers Park High). The Little Sugar Creek Greenway is at the doorstep, and the proximity to both Uptown and South End dining is unmatched.</p>
    <p>The fundamental concern is the #1 priority: community and neighbors. At 31% homeownership, Cherry is overwhelmingly renters and young professionals. The "neighbors with kids who stay for years" dynamic that makes Chantilly or a good Dilworth block so compelling simply doesn't exist here in the same way. The elevated crime statistics (AreaVibes F) and active gentrification tensions add complexity. Cherry is a great urban neighborhood for a young professional couple — it's a harder sell for a family prioritizing stable, community-oriented neighbors.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Colonial Village is a small, quiet residential neighborhood in the 28204 zip code (Elizabeth area), characterized by mid-century homes and colonial-style character. It borders Elizabeth — one of Charlotte's most walkable historic neighborhoods — and shares much of Elizabeth's access to amenities. The neighborhood is genuinely residential and quiet, with a friendly, mixed-demographics community of families and young professionals.</p>
        <p>Residents describe "a tight-knit community spirit" with spacious yards. Politics lean liberal. Niche rates Colonial Village B+ overall. The small size (~1,100 residents) means intimate community scale — the kind of neighborhood where you know your neighbors. It is not a destination neighborhood in the way Plaza Midwood or NoDa are, but that may be a feature rather than a bug for this family: quiet streets, kids playing in yards, walking to Elizabeth's coffee shops.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Primarily mid-century single-family homes (1940s–1960s) in colonial, traditional, and some craftsman styles. Some newer construction townhomes present. Homes tend to have more lot space than Plaza Midwood — backyards are generally reasonable for a family with young children.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Median home price:</strong> ~$625k (November 2025, softening market — down vs. prior year)</li>
          <li><strong>$700k–$900k:</strong> 3–4 bed, 1,800–2,400 sqft, many with yard space. Good purchasing power here.</li>
          <li><strong>$900k–$1.1M:</strong> Upper tier for this market — could find well-updated 4-bed homes with genuine character</li>
          <li>Market has softened (price per sqft down ~20% vs. July 2024) — a potential buyer's opportunity</li>
          <li>Homes selling at or slightly below list price</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (28204 zip):</strong> 99 SFH sales in 28204 (Elizabeth/Chantilly/Colonial Village combined); median $1.0M, 48 sales (48%) in budget. Colonial Village's neighborhood-specific median (~$625k) is lower than the zip average — good purchasing power for this family relative to Chantilly or Elizabeth proper.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 47. Colonial Village itself has limited commercial walkability. But Elizabeth (immediately adjacent) is significantly more walkable, and residents effectively share access to its coffee shops, restaurants, and services. The coffee-within-a-mile threshold is met from most Colonial Village addresses.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Multiple Elizabeth coffee shops within walking distance — Benny's Coffee House (Elizabeth Ave), The People's Market, Not Just Coffee (7th St), Enderly Coffee</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Harris Teeter accessible by short drive; other grocery options in the Elizabeth area. No in-neighborhood walkable grocery.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Elizabeth Avenue restaurant and bar scene accessible on foot or bike; proximity to Plaza Midwood dining is also a benefit</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>The neighborhood's real walkability advantage is borrowed from adjacent Elizabeth. You'll walk 5–15 minutes to reach coffee and casual dining. Not as convenient as Dilworth, but genuinely functional.</span></div>

        <p style="margin-top:12px;"><strong>Elizabeth Traditional Elementary</strong> (CMS magnet): Classical/traditional curriculum, 450 students, 13:1 teacher ratio, 61% math proficiency. As a magnet with a mission-aligned community, parent cohesion may be stronger than a typical attendance-zone school.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Note:</strong> Elizabeth Traditional Elementary's reading proficiency (42%) is below the NC state average (50%). The classical/traditional focus may be a positive or negative depending on the family's educational philosophy — worth visiting the school before committing. The good news: Myers Park High School is the eventual destination, one of Charlotte's strongest. Verify current enrollment and assignment at cmsk12.org.

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Safer than the national average across multiple sources. The residential character and family demographic contribute to lower crime rates. Multiple independent sources note safety as a neighborhood positive attribute. No specific elevated crime concerns identified.</p>
        <p>Being in the 28204 zip, Colonial Village benefits from the same general safety profile as Chantilly and Elizabeth — more established residential fabric than NoDa or Wesley Heights, and without the commercial corridor crime that affects Dilworth's statistics.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Less exciting than top picks</h3>
        <p>Colonial Village is pleasant and solid but not particularly exciting. It is a quieter, more reserved neighborhood feel compared to what you'd find in Chantilly or Dilworth — less block-party energy, more front-porch-and-wave. The homes are mid-century colonial rather than craftsman bungalows. Worth an honest assessment of whether the neighborhood feel resonates.</p>
        <h3>Market softening</h3>
        <p>Price per sqft down ~20% vs. July 2024 — could indicate opportunity for buyers or could reflect underlying demand issues. Worth investigating current market conditions with a local agent before interpreting this as straightforward opportunity.</p>
        <h3>Limited inventory</h3>
        <p>Small neighborhood (~1,100 residents) means infrequent listings. Properties don't turn over often, and when they do it may be at prices that don't fully reflect the softening market. Patience is required.</p>
        <h3>Borrowed walkability</h3>
        <p>The neighborhood's walkable coffee and dining are in adjacent Elizabeth, not Colonial Village itself. This is a meaningful distinction for daily life — you'll walk 5–15 minutes before reaching anything. The bar of "something walkable within a mile" is technically met but not met in the generous sense.</p>
      </div>

    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Moderate.</strong> Colonial Village is a quiet, safe, affordable (relative to budget), and genuinely family-friendly neighborhood with access to Elizabeth's amenities and decent schools. It lacks the immediate walkability and community intensity of Chantilly or Plaza Midwood. For a family prioritizing safety, more yard space, better home-price value, and family density over walkable nightlife and urban energy, Colonial Village is worth a look.</p>
    <p>The softening market is interesting — buyers may have negotiating room here. But this is likely a secondary target after Chantilly, Plaza Midwood, and Dilworth. Visit if you find yourself priced out of higher-demand pockets or if yard space and quiet are elevated priorities. The Myers Park High pipeline is a long-term asset regardless.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Plaza Midwood is one of Charlotte's most sought-after in-town neighborhoods — walkable, eclectic, and established with strong local identity. Originally a streetcar suburb, it's evolved into a genuinely community-driven place: the neighborhood association runs <strong>Midwood Maynia</strong> (spring festival), <strong>Fall Crawl</strong> (kid-friendly Trunk-or-Treat + beer garden), and Movies in the Park. Residents describe it as "laid-back, social, and community-driven." Politically skews liberal, upper-middle-class families mixing with younger professionals and longtime homeowners.</p>
        <p>Development pressure is real: commercial rents surged 175% in five years. The old Midwood Elementary was demolished in late 2025 for a 314-unit apartment tower. A massive 12-acre Commonwealth mixed-use development (1,100,000+ sq ft) is transforming the neighborhood's eastern edge. Some beloved businesses (Tommy's Pub, Book Buyers) have been displaced. The soul is still there but it's being tested.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Why Plaza Midwood is a strong fit:</strong> Walkable coffee, community events, liberal-leaning professional families, and character homes — a neighborhood with genuine energy that rewards daily life on foot. Unlike Chantilly, Plaza Midwood has the bar and restaurant scene of a neighborhood that's also genuinely fun to live in. The Chantilly vs. Plaza Midwood choice comes down to how much you want community insulation (Chantilly) vs. walkable urban vibrancy (Plaza Midwood).

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Primarily craftsman bungalows, four-squares, and cottage-style homes from the 1920s–1940s, with some infill. The best blocks feel established — mature trees, character architecture, front porches.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$800k:</strong> Likely 3-bed, 2-bath, 1,400–1,800 sqft — charming but potentially tight for a WFH family of four. Expect original character with partial updates.</li>
          <li><strong>$800k–$1.1M:</strong> Better 3–4 bed options, 1,800–2,200 sqft; some 4-bed homes at the upper end. This is where the sweet spot lives.</li>
          <li><strong>Price per sqft:</strong> ~$440–446. Homes averaging 66 days on market — notably slowed from 35 days the prior year.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Watch for new construction infill — it can dilute block character. Look for pre-WWII homes on established residential streets away from the Central Avenue commercial corridor.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026, 28205):</strong> 28205 zip covers Plaza Midwood, Commonwealth, and Plaza Hills combined — 928 SFH sales total, median $637.5k, 256 sales (28%) in the $700k–$1.1M budget. Individual neighborhood medians within Plaza Midwood are higher than the zip average due to the geographic mix with lower-priced areas. Price per sqft: ~$440–446.

        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 56 — Somewhat Walkable, but this undersells the actual walkability of the commercial core. Plaza Midwood is cited as Charlotte's most bike-friendly neighborhood due to wide streets with bike lanes. Scores vary significantly by block — the Central Avenue corridor scores considerably higher than the residential interior.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Summit Coffee (on the Plaza), Undercurrent Coffee (2012 Commonwealth Ave — excellent specialty roaster), Common Market (coffee + deli, neighborhood institution), Plot Twist (coffee-to-cocktail bar, opened early 2025), Qahwah House, Haraz Coffee House</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Earth Fare (organic/natural, in-neighborhood), Publix accessible by short drive, Fresh Market nearby</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Supperland (Southern steakhouse in a renovated church — very well-regarded), Calle Sol (Cuban/Peruvian), Moo &amp; Brew (burgers + beer), Sweet Lew's BBQ (wood-fired), Soul Gastrolounge (tapas + sushi, neighborhood icon), Common Market (deli + bar)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Wellness:</span><span>SweatHouz opening at 1711 Commonwealth Ave — private infrared sauna + cold plunge suites. A genuine third-place option for Charlotte's active lifestyle crowd.</span></div>

        <h2><span class="icon">🎓</span> Schools</h2>
        <p>Note: The old Midwood Elementary building was demolished in 2025. School assignment for Plaza Midwood families depends on specific address — some blocks feed into significantly weaker schools than others.</p>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>School pipeline varies dramatically by address.</strong> Specific addresses may feed into Shamrock Gardens ES (5/10 GreatSchools) → Eastway Middle (below avg) → Garinger High (1/10, 57% graduation rate). Do not assume a consistent pipeline — verify your specific address assignment at cmsk12.org before buying. Strong magnet options exist and should be planned from day one.
        </div>
        <p><strong>Best options via CMS lottery:</strong></p>
        <div class="pipeline">
          <div class="pipeline-school">
            <div class="school-name">Highland Mill Montessori</div>
            <div class="school-grade">7/10 GS | Niche A | 87% math</div>

            <div class="school-grade">Top HS in Charlotte</div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p style="margin-top:12px;font-size:0.9rem;"><strong>Also available via magnet lottery:</strong> Chantilly Montessori (8/10 GreatSchools) — another strong public option.</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>For the twins:</strong> Apply for Highland Mill Montessori (3201 Clemson Ave) via the fall 2026 CMS magnet lottery for 2027–28 Kindergarten. This is the most realistic path to a strong elementary from Plaza Midwood. Do not rely on the assigned attendance-zone school without verifying its specific rating for your address.

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>CrimeGrade notes the south portion of Plaza Midwood is safer than the north. Overall crime rate estimated at 37.71 per 1,000 residents annually — ranks in the 48th percentile city-wide. <strong>Violent crime: ~4.09 per 1,000</strong> (relatively low). Property crime is the primary concern, driven largely by the active bar and restaurant scene on Central Avenue.</p>
        <p>In practice, multiple Niche reviews specifically note the ability to "walk everywhere with no safety concerns." The commercial corridor statistics pull the overall numbers up. On residential blocks away from Central Avenue, the feel is substantially safer than the aggregate numbers suggest.</p>

        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> 13.7-mile paved corridor running from NoDa through Plaza Midwood to Pineville via Freedom Park. The primary daily running and biking trail — also the bike commute route to the Uptown CycleLink at 7th Street.</li>
          <li><strong>Midwood Park:</strong> 6-acre neighborhood park with playgrounds, picnic shelter, and amphitheater — hosts most neighborhood events including Midwood Maynia and Movies in the Park.</li>
          <li><strong>Veterans Memorial Park:</strong> Baseball fields, basketball, tennis — 1–2 blocks from many Plaza Midwood homes.</li>
          <li><strong>Cordelia Park:</strong> Sprayground + pool, approximately 2 miles north toward NoDa — accessible via the greenway.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> 98 acres, 10 minutes south by bike via the greenway. 7-acre lake, spray pad, dog park, tennis, kayaking.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Flood risk</h3>
        <p>Little Sugar Creek runs through and near the neighborhood. Homes near the creek can be in FEMA Flood Zone A (high risk). Hurricane Helene (2024) brought 12+ inches to Mecklenburg County, causing widespread flooding. <strong>Check the FEMA Flood Map Service Center for any specific address before making an offer.</strong> This is the single biggest practical risk of buying in Plaza Midwood and is non-negotiable to verify.</p>
        <h3>Development pressure</h3>
        <p>Plaza Midwood is rapidly evolving. The Commonwealth mixed-use project (12 acres, 1.1M+ sqft), apartment towers replacing historic buildings, and 175% commercial rent increases over five years are changing the neighborhood's character. For a family buying now, the question is whether the character homes on established residential blocks will remain insulated from this pressure — many will, but be selective about which specific block you buy on.</p>
        <h3>School assignment</h3>
        <p>Must verify at cmsk12.org. The assigned school pipeline varies dramatically by address within Plaza Midwood. Do not assume a strong school comes with the neighborhood — it is address-specific, and the assigned options for many blocks are weak.</p>
        <h3>Family density on residential blocks</h3>
        <p>Plaza Midwood has a genuine mix of families with young kids, young professionals, and longtime residents. Not a purely family neighborhood — the bar scene is strong and Central Avenue gets lively on weekends. But neighborhood events are family-oriented (kids' parade at Fall Crawl, Midwood Park playground regularly active). Homes on residential blocks away from Central Ave have more family density. The energy is more urban and vibrant than Chantilly — that's a feature for some, a concern for others.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Strong — #2 Recommendation.</strong> Plaza Midwood is the most walkable and most energetic neighborhood on this list. The 8–12 minute bike commute to Uptown is unmatched anywhere else in Charlotte. The coffee and dining scene is genuinely excellent and walkable — multiple strong options within half a mile. The community events feel organic rather than programmed. For a family that wants urban vibrancy alongside neighborhood character, this is the pick.</p>
    <p>Two concerns temper it from the #1 spot: (1) The school pipeline requires active navigation — verify your specific address assignment at cmsk12.org, and plan from day one to apply for Highland Mill Montessori via the CMS magnet lottery. Do not assume the assigned school will be strong. (2) Flood risk on blocks near Little Sugar Creek is real — an FEMA flood zone check before any offer is non-negotiable.</p>
    <p>If those two issues are managed proactively, Plaza Midwood is an excellent home for this family. At $800k–$1.1M, expect a well-updated 3–4 bed craftsman bungalow with character, backyard space, and a neighborhood that genuinely rewards walking out your front door.</p>

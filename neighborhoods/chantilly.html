        <h2><span class="icon">🏘️</span> Character &amp; Vibe</h2>
        <p>Chantilly is Charlotte's hidden gem for this family's profile. It sits between Elizabeth and Plaza Midwood, covering 234 acres with only four entry/exit streets — creating a naturally traffic-calmed, intimate enclave despite being minutes from Uptown. Wide, quiet streets. Mature oak trees. The kind of neighborhood where you know your neighbors' names.</p>
        <p>The community culture is what makes Chantilly stand out. The <strong>"Chantilly Shuffle"</strong> is the local term for what happens when residents decide they love the neighborhood so much they just move to a different house within it rather than leave. Block parties, Halloween parades, and neighborhood events happen because neighbors actually want them. Seven builders specialize exclusively in Chantilly construction — a signal of sustained neighborhood investment. <strong>70% of residents own their homes</strong> — the highest homeownership rate of any neighborhood on this list.</p>
        <p>The population skews young affluent professional and is described as liberal-leaning, consistent with adjacent Elizabeth and Plaza Midwood. Niche ranks it <strong>#6 Best Neighborhood to Buy a House in Charlotte</strong> (A+ overall).</p>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>What makes Chantilly unique:</strong> Four entry points, no through-traffic, 691 homes, established homeowner community, and organic block culture. This is not a marketing description — it's confirmed by multiple independent sources (Charlotte Magazine, Niche reviews, Reddit r/Charlotte, local agents). The "Chantilly Shuffle" — residents who love it so much they just move to a different house within the neighborhood rather than leave — says everything about the community dynamic here.

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🏡</span> Housing Stock</h2>
        <p>Primarily 1940s–1960s Craftsman bungalows and ranch-style homes on quarter-acre lots. Original homes feature hardwood floors, clawfoot tubs, built-in bookshelves, and front porches. Significant renovation and tasteful infill activity as values have appreciated.</p>
        <h3>What your budget buys</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>$700k–$800k:</strong> Lower end of market. Teardown opportunities surface (~$540–620k) or older/smaller originals. Limited but possible.</li>
          <li><strong>$800k–$950k:</strong> Original character homes (1940s–1960s) with original details or partial updates. Realistic for 3–4bd on a quarter-acre lot.</li>
          <li><strong>$950k–$1.1M:</strong> Well-renovated homes, 4bd possible, ~1,800–2,200 sqft with modern systems and original neighborhood aesthetic. Your target budget ceiling lands here.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Budget tension:</strong> At $524/sqft, a true 4bd/2,500 sqft home costs ~$1.3M — above your $1.1M ceiling. You'll likely find excellent 3–4bd homes in the 1,800–2,200 sqft range within budget. New construction in Chantilly reportedly comes in at $2M+ — budget buys original/renovated character homes, not new builds. That's actually aligned with what you want.
        </div>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>County data (2024–Feb 2026, 28204):</strong> 99 SFH sales, median $1.0M, 48 sales (48%) in your $700k–$1.1M range. Very competitive market — 28 days average DOM. When a good home comes up in Chantilly, move quickly.
        </div>
        <p><strong>Standout pockets:</strong> Streets off Clement Avenue and near Chantilly Park are most desirable. The entire neighborhood has a cul-de-sac feel — no "bad" block within Chantilly.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">☕</span> Walkability</h2>
        <p>Walk Score 47 — Chantilly's lowest score on this list, and its one real weakness. The neighborhood itself has no commercial corridor (by design — it's residentially zoned). However, its edges genuinely touch both Elizabeth and Plaza Midwood's walkable scenes.</p>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Coffee:</span><span>Undercurrent Coffee (Plaza Midwood, 5-min walk from some addresses — excellent specialty roaster), Central Coffee (Elizabeth Ave, walkable from edge), Not Just Coffee on 7th St (Elizabeth, ~10 min walk)</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Grocery:</span><span>Common Market (Plaza Midwood, ~0.7 mi — neighborhood market/deli hybrid, community institution), Harris Teeter (short drive), Publix nearby</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Dining:</span><span>Plaza Midwood's restaurant scene is a short walk/bike: Dish (Southern), Midwood Smokehouse (BBQ), Calle Sol (Latin), The Diamond. Elizabeth Ave dining also accessible.</span></div>
        <div class="amenity-row"><span class="amenity-type">Key note:</span><span>The "coffee within a mile walking" threshold is technically met from Chantilly's edges. In practice you'll walk or bike to Plaza Midwood's coffee/dining. This is the main lifestyle trade-off vs. Dilworth — less directly walkable, but the adjacent scenes are genuinely excellent.</span></div>

        <h2><span class="icon">🛡️</span> Safety</h2>
        <p>Chantilly is one of Charlotte's safer close-in neighborhoods. AreaVibes reports crime rate <strong>42% below the national average</strong>. The deliberate street design — only four entry/exit points, no through-traffic — inherently reduces crime by limiting external traffic and creating a natural "eyes on the street" community.</p>
        <p>Residents consistently describe the neighborhood as safe for children playing outside, walking to Plaza Midwood, and leaving doors unlocked. The intimate community structure contributes to this safety.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">🌿</span> Greenways &amp; Parks</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chantilly's own park:</strong> Small neighborhood park within walking distance of most addresses.</li>
          <li><strong>Independence Park (Elizabeth):</strong> 24-acre park, accessible at Chantilly's edge.</li>
          <li><strong>Little Sugar Creek Greenway:</strong> Accessible from the Metropolitan Ave trailhead (~1 mile from Chantilly's center by bike). Connects to 19.5-mile greenway system.</li>
          <li><strong>Freedom Park:</strong> ~2.5–3 miles — bikeable in 15 min. Not walking distance but a short ride.</li>
          <li><strong>Quiet streets as running infrastructure:</strong> Charlotte Magazine describes Chantilly as "a walker/runner's dream, with quiet and low-traffic tree-lined streets." The no-through-traffic design makes the neighborhood itself excellent for outdoor exercise.</li>

        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <h2><span class="icon">⚠️</span> Things to Know</h2>
        <h3>Flood risk</h3>
        <p>Low. Chantilly is not adjacent to major creek corridors. The neighborhood's higher elevation and residential-only design reduce stormwater risk. Standard property-level verification applies.</p>
        <h3>Airport noise</h3>
        <p>Chantilly's location east of Uptown puts it outside the primary CLT departure paths. The proposed flight path expansion (City Council approved studying, pending FAA) is focused on routes north and south of the airport. Lower concern than Myers Park or west-side neighborhoods.</p>
        <h3>Small neighborhood, limited inventory</h3>
        <p>691 homes total. Properties rarely list — when one does, expect competition. The 28-day average DOM means you can't sleep on a good listing. Having a local agent who knows the neighborhood is essential.</p>
        <h3>Development pressure</h3>
        <p>Seven builders specialize in Chantilly construction and renovation. New builds reportedly come online at $2M+. The teardown/rebuild trend is active but managed — the neighborhood association is engaged. The result: some homes are being replaced with larger, more expensive versions, which preserves the overall neighborhood character but can feel jarring at the block level.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card" style="border-left:4px solid var(--teal);">
        <h2><span class="icon">📍</span> Nearby: Collingwood</h2>
        <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:#666;">NPA 13 — adjacent area covered here.</p>
        <p>Collingwood is the quiet residential area adjacent to Chantilly's eastern edge. Primarily <strong>midcentury homes (~$600k)</strong> on tree-lined streets with a suburban-residential feel. The neighborhood benefits from light rail access and shares Chantilly's general safety profile.</p>
        <p>For this family: Collingwood offers a more affordable entry point near Chantilly's community infrastructure, though it lacks Chantilly's distinctive enclave character (no four-entry-point design, less organic block culture). If a home in Chantilly proper doesn't materialize, adjacent Collingwood addresses may still be zoned for the same schools and provide access to the same greenway/amenity network. Worth considering as a fallback, not a primary target.</p>

  <div class="bottom-line">
    <h2>⭐ Bottom Line</h2>
    <p><strong>Fit: Strong — #1 Recommendation.</strong> Chantilly delivers on every community priority: the traffic-calmed enclave structure, 70% homeownership rate, organic community culture, and the "Chantilly Shuffle" dynamic create exactly the established, friendly, community-oriented neighborhood feel this family is prioritizing. The schools are excellent — Eastover Elementary is top-20% in NC with a genuine community feel; Chantilly Montessori offers a bonus option.</p>
    <p>The trade-offs are real but manageable: (1) Walk score of 47 means coffee is a short walk/bike to Plaza Midwood edges, not directly across the street; (2) the budget ($700k–$1.1M) is tight — a true 4bd/2,500 sqft will push to or above $1.1M, meaning you'll be looking at excellent 3–4bd homes in the 1,800–2,200 sqft range within budget; (3) the neighborhood is small with limited inventory — when a good home appears, move on it seriously.</p>
    <p><strong>If one home becomes available in Chantilly at $850k–$1.1M that meets your criteria, it should be at the top of your list to see in person.</strong></p>

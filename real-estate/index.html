  <!-- MARKET CONTEXT -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Charlotte Market Context</h2>
    <p>Charlotte has been one of the fastest-growing housing markets in the Southeast for the better part of a decade. Population growth driven by banking and finance sector expansion, healthcare, tech, and a general Sun Belt migration trend has pushed prices significantly above historical norms. The market has cooled from the 2021–2022 frenzy — that period of waived inspections, 20-offer situations, and 30% over-ask was exceptional — but remains competitive for desirable in-town neighborhoods, particularly in the close-in historic neighborhoods that represent this family's target zone.</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Key Market Facts (2025–2026)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Charlotte MSA home prices have risen approximately <strong>40–60% since 2020</strong>, one of the highest appreciation rates of any major US metro.</li>
          <li><strong>Interest rates (2025-2026):</strong> 6.5–7.5% range for 30-year conventional mortgages — significantly higher than the 2020–2022 environment. Factor this into your monthly cost calculation.</li>
          <li>The market has cooled from the 2021–2022 peak but close-in neighborhoods remain competitive — specifically Chantilly, Elizabeth, Dilworth, and Commonwealth see fast-moving inventory.</li>
          <li>Days on market varies dramatically: as low as 23 days (Commonwealth) and 28 days (Chantilly) for in-demand neighborhoods vs. 66–98 days in Plaza Midwood and NoDa, where you have more time to evaluate.</li>
          <li><strong>North Carolina income tax:</strong> NC has a flat 4.5% state income tax (2025). The net effect at $280k household income depends on deductions and your current state — consult a tax advisor. This is not the slam-dunk tax advantage that moving to Florida or Texas would be.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Price Per Square Foot: Target Neighborhoods</h3>
        <p>The popular narrative that Charlotte is cheaper than other major metros doesn't hold in the close-in historic neighborhoods. These neighborhoods command a real premium — here's what you're actually paying per square foot:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dilworth: ~$440–446/sqft for comparable finished quality</li>
          <li>Chantilly: ~$524/sqft</li>
          <li>Sedgefield: ~$378/sqft — the best value in the target set</li>
          <li>Myers Park: ~$586/sqft — the most expensive target neighborhood</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted);">Charlotte's in-town historic neighborhoods are not "cheap" — they command a significant premium over the metro average precisely because demand from the growing professional class consistently exceeds supply of character homes in walkable locations.</p>
      </div>

  <!-- BUDGET REALITY CHECK -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Budget Reality Check: $700k–$1.1M</h2>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Monthly Cost Estimate</h3>
        <p>At 7% mortgage on $800k financed (assuming $250k–$300k down on a $1.05M–$1.1M home):</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Principal + Interest:</strong> ~$5,300–$5,600/month</li>
          <li><strong>Property taxes:</strong> Mecklenburg County rate ~$1.10–$1.15 per $100 of assessed value. On a $900k home: ~$9,900–$10,350/year = ~$825–$863/month. Note: assessed value may differ from sale price.</li>
          <li><strong>Homeowners insurance:</strong> ~$150–$250/month at this price range in Charlotte</li>
          <li><strong>HOA:</strong> Most target neighborhoods (Dilworth, Chantilly, Sedgefield, Plaza Midwood) have no mandatory HOA for SFH. Some have voluntary neighborhood associations. Factor $0 for HOA in most scenarios.</li>
          <li><strong>All-in monthly housing cost estimate:</strong> approximately $6,300–$6,800/month</li>
        </ul>
        <p>At $280k household income (~$23,333/month gross), this represents <strong>27–29% of gross income to housing</strong> — within conventional lending guidelines and consistent with how financially comfortable families allocate in high-cost-of-housing cities.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Down Payment Scenarios</h3>
        <p>Depending on current equity position and transaction costs (~5-6% in seller fees from your current home sale):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Estimated net proceeds from current home sale: <strong>$550k–$700k</strong> (depending on mortgage balance)</li>
          <li>With $400k–$500k down on a Charlotte home: lower LTV, potentially better rate, and a monthly P+I of ~$3,900–$4,400 on the remaining balance</li>
          <li>Strong existing equity likely provides more flexibility on down payment than typical buyers in this price range</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Timing note:</strong> Coordinating the sale of your current home with the Charlotte purchase is a real logistical challenge. Options include: sell first and rent in Charlotte temporarily (allows patience in the Charlotte search), contingency offer (Charlotte sellers may not accept), or bridge loan (carries cost). Given the competitive nature of Chantilly and Elizabeth in particular, having Charlotte purchase funds available without a contingency is a meaningful advantage.

    <div class="callout warning" style="margin-top:16px;">
      <strong>The 2,500 sqft reality check:</strong> The family's target spec (4bd / ~2,500 sqft / character / backyard) at $700k–$1.1M is achievable in Sedgefield, Elizabeth, and at the top of the budget in Dilworth, Plaza Midwood, and Commonwealth. Chantilly and Myers Park require either accepting smaller square footage or going above $1.1M. Sedgefield offers the most realistic path to the full target spec within budget.

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>How Fast Does Inventory Move?</h3>
        <p>Days on market (DOM) data tells you a lot about how much time you have once a good home lists:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Chantilly (~28 days DOM):</strong> A good home in Chantilly — at the right price, right condition — will receive offers within days of listing. Same-day response is not an overstatement. If you see something you love here, schedule a showing immediately and be prepared to move.</li>
          <li><strong>Commonwealth (~23 days DOM):</strong> The fastest-moving market in the target set. Even faster than Chantilly. Having a preapproval letter and an agent relationship in place before you arrive is essential.</li>
          <li><strong>Dilworth (~varies):</strong> Faster for well-priced, well-presented homes in the $850k-$1M range; slower for properties at the top of the budget or needing significant work. Generally allow 1-2 weeks for good properties.</li>
          <li><strong>Elizabeth (~54 days DOM):</strong> More time to evaluate — but don't mistake this for low competition. The 54-day average includes properties at multiple price points and conditions. A well-priced 4-bed in Elizabeth at $950k will still move quickly.</li>
          <li><strong>Plaza Midwood (~66 days DOM):</strong> The most patient market. You have time to evaluate, negotiate, and do due diligence. This is the neighborhood where you can be thoughtful rather than reactive.</li>
          <li><strong>NoDa (~98 days DOM):</strong> Significant time on market for SFH in the target price range — more negotiating room.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Home Search Strategy</h3>
        <ol style="padding-left:18px;">
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Get preapproval first — before you search seriously.</strong> Charlotte agents (especially in Chantilly and Commonwealth) will not show homes without it, and you will lose competitive situations if you're still getting documentation together when a home lists.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Hire a buyer's agent who specializes in your target neighborhoods</strong> — a Chantilly / Elizabeth specialist has fundamentally different market knowledge than a Myers Park or south Charlotte specialist. Ask explicitly about their recent sales in the specific sub-neighborhoods you're targeting.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Set up real-time alerts on Zillow, Redfin, and Realtor.</strong> In Chantilly especially, same-day notification and same-day showing scheduling matters.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Budget for earnest money:</strong> In Charlotte, 1-2% of purchase price is typical earnest money. On a $950k home, that's $9,500–$19,000 that needs to be accessible quickly when you make an offer.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Inspection contingencies:</strong> Standard in Charlotte's current market (unlike the peak frenzy of 2021-22). Don't waive an inspection on a 1940s–1960s bungalow — these homes can have foundation, electrical, plumbing, and HVAC surprises that matter at this price point.</li>
          <li style="margin-bottom:8px;"><strong>Look up assessed values before you offer.</strong> Mecklenburg County assessed value (available at cao.mecknc.gov) may differ significantly from list or sale price — and property tax is based on assessed value, not sale price. Assessed values are re-evaluated periodically; recent sales in a neighborhood can trigger reassessment.</li>

  <!-- FLOOD RISK NOTE -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Risk Factors to Evaluate Per Property</h2>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Flood Risk</h3>
        <p>Creek-adjacent properties in Charlotte's historic neighborhoods carry real flood risk that varies dramatically by specific parcel — not just neighborhood. This is not an abstract concern: Little Sugar Creek has flooded historically during major storm events, and FEMA flood maps show Zone AE (high risk) parcels scattered through Dilworth and Plaza Midwood that are immediately adjacent to Zone X (minimal risk) parcels.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Highest flood risk areas in target neighborhoods:</strong> Dilworth creek-adjacent streets, Plaza Midwood near Little Sugar Creek. Verify flood zone on any property near the creek corridor.</li>
          <li><strong>What to do:</strong> Look up <em>every specific address you're considering</em> at FEMA's Flood Map Service Center (msc.fema.gov). Flood zone designation (AE vs. X) determines whether flood insurance is required and what it will cost. A Zone AE property in a FEMA Special Flood Hazard Area can add $1,500–$4,000+/year in required flood insurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Not all creek-adjacent properties are at risk</strong> — elevation matters significantly. But verify before you fall in love with a property.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Airport Noise</h3>
        <p>Charlotte Douglas International Airport sits to the west of the target neighborhoods. The primary flight paths run east-west — neighborhoods directly west of center (including Wilmore) experience more ambient noise than those further east (Dilworth, Chantilly, Plaza Midwood).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Currently, most target neighborhoods are not significantly impacted by airport noise during standard operations</li>
          <li><strong>Watch:</strong> Charlotte City Council in December 2024 approved studying new departure routes — Myers Park was specifically named as potentially affected by proposed changes. FAA approval still pending. Not a current issue but worth monitoring, especially for Myers Park.</li>
          <li>Visit target properties in the morning (peak departure times) to assess noise level personally</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Construction Activity &amp; Neighborhood Change</h3>
        <p>Charlotte's in-town neighborhoods are active development zones — infill construction, townhome development replacing single-family lots, and commercial expansion are all happening at pace. This creates short-term disruption (construction noise, truck traffic, changed neighborhood character on specific blocks) and longer-term implications for neighborhood density and character.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dilworth and Chantilly have seen meaningful infill; the scale is contained by lot size and zoning but is present</li>
          <li>Plaza Midwood and Commonwealth have seen more significant density increases — townhomes on formerly single-family lots are common</li>
          <li>NoDa has the most active development activity of any target neighborhood; the character is actively changing as investment flows in</li>
          <li>Sedgefield has been relatively stable but is not immune to infill as south Charlotte land values rise</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Crime Considerations</h3>
        <p>Charlotte's target neighborhoods have varying crime profiles — this is worth researching at the block level rather than the neighborhood level, as crime concentration within neighborhoods is uneven.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Chantilly and Myers Park: among the lowest crime rates in the close-in neighborhoods</li>
          <li>Dilworth and Elizabeth: generally low; some property crime near commercial corridors</li>
          <li>Plaza Midwood and NoDa: higher crime concentration around the bar/entertainment districts (Central Ave, 36th St) — residential blocks are generally more insulated but proximity matters</li>
          <li>Use AreaVibes and CMPD's online crime mapping tool to check specific streets before committing to a property</li>
        </ul>

  <!-- PROPERTY RESEARCH TOOLS -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Property Research Tools</h2>
    <p>Before making an offer on any Charlotte property, these tools allow you to independently research the parcel's history, risk profile, and context:</p>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mecklenburg County Assessor — cao.mecknc.gov</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted);">Look up any parcel's assessed value, ownership history, year built, square footage, and property details. The gold standard for pre-offer research. Free public access. Assessed value determines property tax; may differ significantly from list price.</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top:12px;">
            <strong>Mecklenburg County Open Data — maps.mecknc.gov/openmapping/</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted);">GIS-based access to zoning maps, flood zone boundaries, school assignment zones, parks, bike routes, and parcel data. Useful for understanding what surrounds a specific property — zoning for adjacent lots, proximity to greenways, exact school zone boundary.</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top:12px;">
            <strong>FEMA Flood Map Service Center — msc.fema.gov</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted);">Look up any address for its official FEMA flood zone designation. Zone AE = high risk / flood insurance required. Zone X = minimal risk. Essential for any creek-adjacent property in the target neighborhoods, particularly in Dilworth and Plaza Midwood.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CMS School Finder — cmsk12.org</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted);">Look up the assigned public school for any specific address. School assignment zones do not follow neighborhood boundaries exactly — a half-block difference can change the assigned elementary school. Verify before buying, not after. Particularly important for the Dilworth boundary change (new Park Road Elementary opening fall 2026).</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top:12px;">
            <strong>CMPD Crime Mapping — charlottenc.gov/cmpd</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted);">Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department publishes crime incident data by address. Use this to evaluate specific blocks within a neighborhood, not just neighborhood-level summaries.</span>
          </li>
          <li style="margin-top:12px;">
            <strong>Redfin / Zillow Property History</strong><br>
            <span style="font-size:0.9rem; color:var(--text-muted);">Check how many times a property has been listed, the price history, and days on market history. A property that has been listed and relisted multiple times warrants additional scrutiny — understand why it hasn't sold.</span>
          </li>
        </ul>

    </div>

    <div class="callout info" style="margin-top:16px;">
      <strong>One more research tool worth knowing:</strong>
      The Mecklenburg County property API at property.spatialest.com/nc/mecklenburg/ provides public access to all county property transaction and assessment records — including sale price, sale date, square footage, year built, and full parcel history for every property in the county. This is the same data source used for the summary tables throughout this website. No login required; public record.

  <!-- ===== HOW CMS WORKS ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2><span class="icon">🏫</span> How Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) Works</h2>

    <h3>The Assignment System</h3>
    <p>CMS uses a <strong>neighborhood assignment model</strong>: every student is assigned to a "home school" based on their residential address. This is your default/fallback school. However, CMS has an extensive school choice system on top of this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neighborhood school:</strong> Automatic based on address. Free busing within zone.</li>
      <li><strong>Magnet schools:</strong> Theme-based programs (Montessori, STEAM, Arts, IB, World Languages) open to all CMS students via annual lottery. Up to 3 choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Charter schools:</strong> Publicly funded but independently operated. Separate lottery. No home address requirement.</li>
      <li><strong>Private schools:</strong> No assignment system; apply directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Magnet Lottery</h3>
    <p>Application window: mid-October through early December for the following school year. Results announced early January. You can select up to <strong>3 school choices</strong>. If not selected, placed on a waitlist (seats often open through August as families decline).</p>
    <p><strong>Transportation note:</strong> Bus service to a magnet school is only provided if it falls within your designated transportation zone (determined by your assigned high school). Out-of-zone magnet choices are allowed but may require you to provide transportation.</p>
    <div class="callout info">
      <strong>CMS Magnet Overhaul Coming:</strong> CMS is proposing to reduce magnet themes from 16 to 6 (consolidating around Arts, Montessori, STEM, Early College, World Languages, and IB/LI/TD). Vote expected 2026; changes not before 2027-28 at earliest. This creates some uncertainty but potentially simplifies choices by the time your kids enter Kindergarten.
    </div>

    <h3>Pre-K in CMS — Honest Assessment</h3>
    <p>CMS runs <strong>Bright Beginnings</strong> Pre-K (63 schools, ~3,240 four-year-olds). Eligibility is needs-based and income-based. <strong>At $280k household income, your family almost certainly does not qualify.</strong> North Carolina Pre-K (state-funded) has the same income restrictions. CMS Bright Beginnings is not a realistic option for this family.</p>
    <p><strong>Your Pre-K path:</strong> MECK Pre-K (free, no income limit — see below), private school Pre-K (Charlotte Prep, Charlotte Country Day, Charlotte Latin), or a local independent Pre-K program for a bridge year while you navigate the 2027-28 Kindergarten lottery and admissions cycle.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== MECK PRE-K ===== -->
  <div class="card" id="meck-prek">
    <h2><span class="icon">🌟</span> MECK Pre-K — Free Public Pre-K (No Income Requirement)</h2>

    <div class="callout info" style="margin-bottom:20px;">
      <strong>Good news for your family:</strong> Unlike CMS Bright Beginnings and NC Pre-K, MECK Pre-K has <strong>no income eligibility requirement</strong>. It is open to any family with a 4-year-old living in Mecklenburg County. Your twins turn 4 in April 2026 — well before the August 31 cutoff — making them age-eligible for fall 2026 Pre-K.
    </div>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>What Is MECK Pre-K?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Free public pre-kindergarten</strong> run by Mecklenburg County — separate from CMS, Head Start, and NC Pre-K</li>
          <li>Funded by Mecklenburg County and Smart Start; operated at sites across the county</li>
          <li>One of four public Pre-K programs in Mecklenburg County — the only one with no income or academic need restrictions</li>
          <li>High-quality, structured program preparing 4-year-olds for Kindergarten</li>
          <li>Multiple classroom sites across Mecklenburg County</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Eligibility — Simple</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Child must be <strong>4 years old on or before August 31</strong> of the enrollment year</li>
          <li>Must live in <strong>Mecklenburg County</strong></li>
          <li><strong>No income requirement</strong> — open to all income levels (income restriction was removed in 2021)</li>
          <li>Your twins: born April 2026, they turn 4 before August 31, 2026 — <strong>fully eligible for fall 2026</strong></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>How Enrollment Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rolling/ongoing enrollment</strong> — not a one-time annual lottery like CMS magnets</li>
          <li>Registration for 2026-27 opened January 21, 2026 — apply now</li>
          <li>First-come, first-served within available slots; spots fill as applications come in</li>
          <li>Apply online: <strong>ascend.meckprek.com</strong></li>
          <li>Or call: <strong>704-943-9585</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:16px;">Important Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>This is <strong>separate from</strong> CMS Pre-K, private Pre-K, and the CMS magnet lottery system</li>
          <li>Applying here does not affect your eligibility for private school or the 2027-28 magnet lottery</li>
          <li>Apply early — enrollment is rolling but slots fill. Program officials noted in January 2026 they expect high application volume</li>
          <li>You can use MECK Pre-K for fall 2026 as a bridge year while pursuing private Kindergarten or the magnet lottery for fall 2027</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="callout warning" style="margin-top:16px;">
          <strong>Action required now:</strong> Even though you won't arrive in Charlotte until summer 2026, start the application at ascend.meckprek.com as soon as you have a Mecklenburg County address. Call 704-943-9585 to ask about the process for families relocating mid-year.

      <strong>Major Boundary Change — Fall 2026 (affects Dilworth &amp; Wilmore):</strong> CMS is opening a new elementary school on the old Park Road site in Fall 2026. ~829 students currently zoned to Dilworth Elementary and Marie G.

    <div class="callout info" style="margin-top:20px;">
      <strong>On Plaza Midwood, Commonwealth, and Plaza Hills pipelines:</strong> The default neighborhood assignment (Shamrock Gardens 5/10 → Eastway Middle 4/10 → Garinger High 1/10) is not the right fit for this family — but this is exactly the situation where Charlotte's magnet, charter, and private options make a real difference. These are among Charlotte's most desirable urban neighborhoods precisely because families who live there navigate school choice successfully. Plan magnet/charter/private from day one and treat the neighborhood school as a fallback only. The 2027-28 CMS magnet lottery (applying fall 2026) and private school applications (also fall 2026) are your primary levers.

    <p style="font-size:0.85rem;color:var(--text-muted);margin-top:8px;">GreatSchools middle school ratings are heavily influenced by demographics and can obscure program quality. Alexander Graham's low GS rating does not reflect the actual academic environment for college-bound students on the shared Myers Park campus. Eastway's low scores, by contrast, reflect a genuine concern.</p>

      <strong>Myers Park High is the goal for most neighborhoods on this list.</strong> At 3,539 students on a 62-acre campus shared with Selwyn Elementary and Alexander Graham Middle, it functions more like a small college. Strong AP/IB programs for motivated students. Most of the target neighborhoods — Myers Park, Chantilly, Elizabeth, Dilworth, Sedgefield, Colonial Village, Wilmore — feed here automatically.

    <h2><span class="icon">🏛️</span> Charter Schools</h2>

    <div class="two-col">
      <div>
        <h3>Corvian Community School ⭐ Top Recommendation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GreatSchools: 9/10 | Student Progress: 10/10</strong></li>
          <li>Location: 4041 Johnston Oehler Rd (north Charlotte — ~20–25 min from target neighborhoods)</li>
          <li>Grades K-12 | Enrollment: 1,294</li>
          <li>Reading 69%, Math 77%, English 90% (far above state avg)</li>
          <li>Outperforms 97% of similar NC schools on student progress</li>
          <li>AP courses: 16 | Graduation rate: 95%+</li>
          <li>Demographic diversity: 51% White, 26% Black, 12% Hispanic</li>
          <li>Lottery: Lotterease system; sibling/staff priority</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Concerns:</strong> (1) Location is north Charlotte — a significant daily drive commitment; (2) Teacher turnover has been flagged by multiple parent reviews (~15 teachers/year, high rate); (3) AIG (gifted) program was reportedly dissolved at some point. Investigate the turnover issue directly by talking to current parents.
        </div>
        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The best academic charter in the area. If the location works and the family is comfortable with the turnover dynamics, this is worth prioritizing in the lottery.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Charlotte Lab School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GreatSchools: 5/10 | Niche: B</strong></li>
          <li>Location: 301 E 9th St, Uptown Charlotte — adjacent to the US Bank office</li>
          <li>Grades K-12 | Enrollment: 1,002</li>
          <li>Reading 57%, Math 46% (near or below state average)</li>
          <li>Demographics: 44% Black, 26% White, 17% Hispanic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong>drop-off-on-the-way-to-work scenario</strong> is a genuine logistical appeal — literally a block from the Uptown office. Academics are not strong enough to recommend on merit alone. The school has a nurturing small-school reputation; high turnover is also cited. Worth visiting if the Uptown location works logistically for the family.</p>

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">CMS Magnet Lottery — Key Options for Fall 2027</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apply to 3 choices</strong> in the October 2026 lottery (for 2027-28 Kindergarten)</li>
          <li>Attend CMS magnet open houses in fall 2026 before selecting</li>
          <li>Top options to investigate: <strong>Chantilly Montessori, Sedgefield Montessori (TOPS), First Ward Creative Arts, University Park Creative Arts</strong>, Myers Park Traditional Elementary (7/10), Randolph IB Middle (for middle school planning)</li>
          <li>Register your children in CMS as soon as you have a Charlotte address (summer 2026) — this gets them a student ID and home school assignment before the lottery opens</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Charlotte Preparatory School ⭐ Best Fit</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: 212 Boyce Rd (Stonehaven — closer to target neighborhoods than south Charlotte privates; ~15–20 min from Dilworth/Myers Park)</li>
          <li>Grades: Pre-Primary (age 2) through 8th grade</li>
          <li>Tuition: ~$17,400 (Pre-K/Primary) to $26,250 (upper grades) per child</li>
          <li>Enrollment: ~428 | Student-teacher ratio: 7:1</li>
          <li>Montessori-influenced early years; strong community feel</li>
          <li>"Families know the faculty, staff, leaders, and other families on a personal level"</li>
          <li>Acceptance rate: ~40%</li>
          <li><strong>Stops at 8th grade</strong> — need a high school plan (Myers Park High or private)</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout info">
          <strong>Why this is the #1 private fit:</strong> Small school, Montessori-influenced Pre-K, community-oriented culture, not status-obsessed, more accessible location than Latin/Country Day. The parent community here is warm and engaged — this is a school where families genuinely connect. Pre-K entry is ideal for 4-year-olds. Contact admissions immediately for fall 2026 late applications: 704-366-5994.

        <h3>Charlotte Country Day School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: 1440 Carmel Rd (SouthPark/south Charlotte — 20–30 min from target neighborhoods)</li>
          <li>Grades: JK (age 4) through 12th | Tuition: $24,515 (JK) to $34,075 (HS) per child</li>
          <li>Niche: A+ | 8:1 student-teacher ratio (exceptional)</li>
          <li>60+ nationalities represented; diverse, progressive reputation</li>
          <li>"Wonderful sense of community among parents and staff"</li>
          <li>Less "inner circle" feel than Charlotte Latin</li>
          <li><strong>JK/K admissions deadline passed (Dec 31, 2025)</strong> — contact immediately about waitlist and for fall 2027 preparation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Charlotte Latin School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: 9502 Providence Rd (far south Charlotte — 25–35 min from target neighborhoods)</li>
          <li>Grades: TK–12 | Tuition: $27,600 (TK/K) to $36,500 (HS) per child</li>
          <li>Academically excellent; top-ranked private in Charlotte</li>
          <li><strong>Culture caveat:</strong> Known for an "inner circle" dynamic that some families find exclusive. Skews affluent and traditional. May not feel like the right community for this family. Location is also a significant daily drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Providence Day School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: South Charlotte | Tuition: ~$34,430+/child</li>
          <li>Academically elite; diverse; non-religious; 30 AP courses; avg SAT 1,370</li>
          <li><strong>Cost at twins pricing: ~$68k+/year</strong> — significant strain on $280k income alongside a $700k–$1.1M mortgage</li>
          <li>Consider if academic pedigree is the top priority and cost is manageable</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout warning" style="margin-top:20px;">
      <strong>Private Schools to Skip for This Family:</strong> Charlotte Christian and Covenant Day are explicitly faith-based/Christ-centered — not the right fit for a non-religious family. Charlotte Latin's exclusive culture is a mismatch. Providence Day is worth considering only if the ~$68k/year twin tuition is comfortable.

    <div class="callout info" style="margin-top:20px;">
      <strong>Strategic bottom line:</strong> If you buy in <strong>Myers Park/Selwyn area (28207)</strong>, you have a world-class neighborhood public school as your default (Selwyn, 9/10) — this eliminates most of the school navigation complexity. The magnet lottery becomes an optional upgrade rather than a necessity. If you buy in <strong>Plaza Midwood</strong> (the best neighborhood for lifestyle), you must have a firm private school or magnet plan before middle school — the assigned high school pipeline (Garinger, 1/10) is not an acceptable default. Chantilly and Elizabeth give you Eastover Elementary (8/10) as a strong neighborhood default. And regardless of neighborhood: <strong>apply to MECK Pre-K now</strong> — it's free, open to your family, and a great bridge year option for fall 2026.

<div class="page-content">
  <p class="summary" style="max-width:760px;margin-bottom:32px;">Your twins turn 4 in April 2026 and will enter Pre-K or Kindergarten in fall 2026/2027. This guide covers how CMS works, school pipelines by neighborhood, magnet options, charter schools, and private schools — with honest assessments of fit for your family.</p>

  <div class="callout warning" style="margin-bottom:32px;">
    <strong>⏰ Time-Sensitive:</strong> The CMS magnet lottery for 2026-27 closed December 5, 2025. <strong>You missed it for this year</strong> — but that's okay. Your primary window is the 2027-28 lottery (opening ~October 2026), which aligns with Kindergarten entry. For private school Pre-K in fall 2026: contact Charlotte Prep, Charlotte Country Day, and Charlotte Latin immediately — late applications and waitlists may still exist.

  <!-- ===== HOW CMS WORKS ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2><span class="icon">🏫</span> How Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) Works</h2>

    <h3>The Assignment System</h3>
    <p>CMS uses a <strong>neighborhood assignment model</strong>: every student is assigned to a "home school" based on their residential address. This is your default/fallback school. However, CMS has an extensive school choice system on top of this:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Neighborhood school:</strong> Automatic based on address. Free busing within zone.</li>
      <li><strong>Magnet schools:</strong> Theme-based programs (Montessori, STEAM, Arts, IB, World Languages) open to all CMS students via annual lottery. Up to 3 choices.</li>
      <li><strong>Charter schools:</strong> Publicly funded but independently operated. Separate lottery. No home address requirement.</li>
      <li><strong>Private schools:</strong> No assignment system; apply directly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Magnet Lottery</h3>
    <p>Application window: mid-October through early December for the following school year. Results announced early January. You can select up to <strong>3 school choices</strong>. If not selected, placed on a waitlist (seats often open through August as families decline).</p>
    <p><strong>Transportation note:</strong> Bus service to a magnet school is only provided if it falls within your designated transportation zone (determined by your assigned high school). Out-of-zone magnet choices are allowed but may require you to provide transportation.</p>
    <div class="callout info">
      <strong>CMS Magnet Overhaul Coming:</strong> CMS is proposing to reduce magnet themes from 16 to 6 (consolidating around Arts, Montessori, STEM, Early College, World Languages, and IB/LI/TD). Vote expected 2026; changes not before 2027-28 at earliest. This creates some uncertainty but potentially simplifies choices by the time your kids enter Kindergarten.
    </div>

    <h3>Pre-K in CMS — Honest Assessment</h3>
    <p>CMS runs <strong>Bright Beginnings</strong> Pre-K (63 schools, ~3,240 four-year-olds). Eligibility is needs-based and income-based. <strong>At $280k household income, your family almost certainly does not qualify.</strong> North Carolina Pre-K (state-funded) has the same income restrictions. Public Pre-K is not a realistic option for this family.</p>
    <p><strong>Your Pre-K path:</strong> Private school Pre-K (Charlotte Prep, Charlotte Country Day, Charlotte Latin), or a local independent Pre-K program for a bridge year while you navigate the 2027-28 Kindergarten lottery and admissions cycle.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- ===== SCHOOL PIPELINES ===== -->
  <div class="card">
    <h2><span class="icon">🗺️</span> School Pipelines by Neighborhood</h2>

    <div class="callout warning">
      <strong>Major Boundary Change — Fall 2026 (affects Dilworth &amp; Wilmore):</strong> CMS is opening a new elementary school on the old Park Road site in Fall 2026. ~829 students currently zoned to Dilworth Elementary and Marie G. Davis K-8 will move to the new Park Road school. The existing Dilworth building becomes a magnet middle school. If you buy in Dilworth or Wilmore, verify your specific address assignment directly with CMS.

          <li><strong>GreatSchools: 9/10 | Student Progress: 10/10</strong></li>
          <li>Location: 4041 Johnston Oehler Rd (north Charlotte — ~20–25 min from target neighborhoods)</li>

          <li>Demographic diversity: 51% White, 26% Black, 12% Hispanic</li>
          <li>Lottery: Lotterease system; sibling/staff priority</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="callout warning">
          <strong>Concerns:</strong> (1) Location is north Charlotte — a significant daily drive commitment; (2) Teacher turnover has been flagged by multiple parent reviews (~15 teachers/year, high rate); (3) AIG (gifted) program was reportedly dissolved at some point. Investigate the turnover issue directly by talking to current parents.
        </div>
        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The best academic charter in the area. If the location works and the family is comfortable with the turnover dynamics, this is worth prioritizing in the lottery.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h3>Charlotte Lab School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GreatSchools: 5/10 | Niche: B</strong></li>
          <li>Location: 301 E 9th St, Uptown Charlotte — adjacent to his office at US Bank</li>
          <li>Grades K-12 | Enrollment: 1,002</li>
          <li>Reading 57%, Math 46% (near or below state average)</li>
          <li>Demographics: 44% Black, 26% White, 17% Hispanic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <strong>drop-off-on-the-way-to-work scenario</strong> is a genuine logistical appeal — literally a block from his Uptown office. Academics are not strong enough to recommend on merit alone. The school has a nurturing small-school reputation; high turnover is also cited. Worth visiting if the Uptown location works logistically for the family.</p>

          <strong>Why this is the #1 private fit:</strong> Small school, Montessori-influenced Pre-K, community-oriented culture, not status-obsessed, more accessible location than Latin/Country Day. The parent community here will likely feel like "your people" — similar to Lynnhurst's neighbor culture. Pre-K entry is ideal for 4-year-olds. Contact admissions immediately for fall 2026 late applications: 704-366-5994.

          <li><strong>JK/K admissions deadline passed (Dec 31, 2025)</strong> — contact immediately about waitlist and for fall 2027 preparation</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Charlotte Latin School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: 9502 Providence Rd (far south Charlotte — 25–35 min from target neighborhoods)</li>
          <li>Grades: TK–12 | Tuition: $27,600 (TK/K) to $36,500 (HS) per child</li>
          <li>Academically excellent; top-ranked private in Charlotte</li>
          <li><strong>Culture caveat:</strong> Known for an "inner circle" dynamic that some families find exclusive. Skews affluent and traditional. May not feel like the right community for this family. Location is also a significant daily drive.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 style="margin-top:20px;">Providence Day School</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Location: South Charlotte | Tuition: ~$34,430+/child</li>
          <li>Academically elite; diverse; non-religious; 30 AP courses; avg SAT 1,370</li>
          <li><strong>Cost at twins pricing: ~$68k+/year</strong> — significant strain on $280k income alongside a $700k–$1.1M mortgage</li>
          <li>Consider if academic pedigree is the top priority and cost is manageable</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="callout warning" style="margin-top:20px;">
      <strong>Private Schools to Skip for This Family:</strong> Charlotte Christian and Covenant Day are explicitly faith-based/Christ-centered — not the right fit for a non-religious family. Charlotte Latin's exclusive culture is a mismatch. Providence Day is worth considering only if the ~$68k/year twin tuition is comfortable.

      <strong>Strategic bottom line:</strong> If you buy in <strong>Myers Park/Selwyn area (28207)</strong>, you have a world-class neighborhood public school as your default (Selwyn, 9/10) — this eliminates most of the school navigation complexity. The magnet lottery becomes an optional upgrade rather than a necessity. If you buy in <strong>Plaza Midwood</strong> (the best neighborhood for lifestyle), you must have a firm private school or magnet plan before middle school — the assigned high school pipeline (Garinger, 1/10) is not an acceptable default. Chantilly and Elizabeth give you Eastover Elementary (8/10) as a strong neighborhood default.
